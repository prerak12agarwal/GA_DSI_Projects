,legaladvice,"I (19M) was with my abusive ex for about 5 months (24/25M). He was coming out of a bad relationship himself so with barely knowing him, I offered him to stay at my apartment with his cats and dogs (2 dogs and 2 cats). I needed a roommate as mine had just moved out, and I thought it’d be perfect (Im young and stupid I know). I had no idea for the hell I would live in. He was controlling and emotionally manipulative (I couldn’t go to classes because “what about him” and “I didn’t really love him if I went” + any time I would go he’d go into a suicidal rampage). During this time I also had a dog. One day he came home with another dog. Then another. Then another. And cats too. I repeatedly asked him to stop and he never did, and he expected me to solely care for the animals, pay the bills (including 1100/mo rent), all while he never worked and had my bank info so any time I got money he’d immediately use it for himself. Any time I’d confront him he’d go into a suicidal bout and talk about how he should “just kill himself” then. Because of the apartment conditions I eventually developed a kidney infection with an uncommon strain and was completely bathroom/bed ridden. Eventually there were 10 dogs and 10 cats in this apartment (including my now 2 dogs, who I took care of separately and went out of my way to make sure were as healthy as I could provide for and had separate food, toys, and treats). Animal control was called and all animals were seized, I went to court to get my dogs back and spent 2000+ in lawyer fees and general court fees as they said I was an accessory (my parent wound up being able to get my original dog back which sucks I couldn’t get the other one too but hey what’re you going to do). During the court case the cop repeatedly misgendered me (We’re both FtM) and *laughed* when I said I had had a kidney infection and that I’m blind (I was diagnosed at birth with a rare genetic condition, I have the medical documents to back up both these claims) and it was generally awful. The worst though was after the animals were seized I had moved out after my ex had raped me (He got me blackout drunk while he was sober so he could sleep with me thinking it’d get me to stay as he knew after my animals I hated him and didn’t want to be with him and to get away. I already had a friend who was actively trying to help me leave) and my ex squated on the property and wouldn’t let me pick up my stuff. I salvaged what I could from when I had moved out but the rest had to be thrown out, and countless memories with yearbooks and what not were lost because he wouldn’t let me inside. Do I have any legal recourse to get money from him so I can get fees back, money for new stuff or *something*? Sorry this was long.

,legaladvice,"Here's a quick summary of my situation: about seven months ago, I had an emergency and needed to move out of state to be closer to family. I talked it over with my roommate (Mike) at the time, since we were only halfway through our lease and I didn't want to leave him high and dry. He said he was comfortable with me leaving, and instead of breaking our lease wanted to sublet my room to one of his friends (Sarah).

After explaining the situation to our landlord, the landlord said that we would have to sort the details ourselves as far as replacing initial finances (first/last month's rent and security deposit). I first texted Mike to explain that I would send an email asking Sarah for first month's rent (a prorated amount for the month I was moving out, since I had already paid for that full month), last month's rent, and the security deposit in the amount of one month's rent. He agreed that this would be fair. I then sent an email to Mike, Sarah, and CC-ed myself explaining the same thing. After sending it, I got a text from Mike saying that it wasn't fair for Sarah to pay this much because ""nobody has that kind of money to move"" (red flag #1). We went back and forth and eventually agreed that she would not have to worry about the security deposit, since I ""would probably get it back anyways"".

Fast forward to the week I am about to move out, Mike comes tome and explains that it's unfair for Sarah to pay last month's rent and that she should only pay first month's rent (red flag #2). At this point he already knows that I have quit my job and made plans to live in another state, so it's too late for me to stay at this point. I pushed back and explained that I thought it was fair because I essentially already paid her last month of living, and therefore she should pay me back. After going back in forth, Mike verbally agreed to reimburse me for last month's rent. On my move-out day, I was venmo-ed the prorated first month's rent and was told that Mike would venmo me at some point for last month's rent (red flag #3).

Within a few weeks of moving, I tried reaching out to Mike about last month's rent. He never responded. I decided to wait until our last month of the original lease (this month) and then reach out to Sarah to see if she had planned on paying me. I tried reaching out repeatedly over Venmo and text but was ignored. It had been three weeks of me trying to get in touch with her.

My last month's rent was around $750. As someone in their mid-20's with chronic illness, that's a lot of money to me. I'm incredibly anxious because I'm still not sure if I will get my security deposit back, which would total around $1500 lost from this living situation.

It this worth taking my subletter to small claims court for? Do I have a case? I have text and email receipts of agreements for her to pay my last month's rent, but am not sure if this is enough.

Without PTO, and with how they’re slashing our paychecks, if someone gets sick, we won’t be paid for the days off and many of us can’t afford that right now:

They received the PPP loan, but have slashed hours/salaries to 1/4 of what they were. If we go back to work, we will be making less than what base unemployment is in our state (FL). We will be making around $250 a week before taxes. On unemployment, we were making around what our salaries were pre-COVID ($275 before taxes for state unemployment benefits +$600 federal). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our employers have around 50 employees, and the higher ups, like the practice manager and partners are making full salary while working reduced hours, while “regular” staff’s pay is slashed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re also not putting any precautions in place to prevent the spread of coronavirus, used up all of our paid time-off (no sick pay) to pay us out when we were furloughed initially (no permission granted), and did not pay a coworker who had to quarantine prior to them shutting down (they paid out that coworkers PTO, and sent them to unemployment, though the CARES act states those forced to quarantine were due regular salary). Without PTO, and with how they’re slashing our paychecks, if someone gets sick, we won’t be paid for the days off and many of us can’t afford that right now: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we have any recourse? Do we have to return to work, or will we be placed off of unemployment if we reject? Any advice appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"I’m (24F) back again because of my crazy sister L (34F). Several years ago my mom (61F) added L to the deed of her home. My moms reasoning was 2/4 kids were minors, L was in her early to mid 20s. And my mom didn’t have a husband to leave her home to. I believe she was ill advised by her lawyer and L didn’t need to be added to the deed. I still live with my mom while trying to get out of student debt and save for a home. I do not pay rent but my mom has never asked me to and I help out with what I can. L lives in her own home. 

Anyway, let’s fast forward to September 2019. L and I got into an argument over her kids (8F and 4F) making the house messy and having no respect for people’s belongings. One of the kids took a bracelet from me that holds the ashes of a loved one. I was made at L for not disciplining her kids or cleaning up after them. L threatened to put a protective order on me and have me thrown out of my moms house. She did not have cause for this as I never threatened her or became violent. L stated she was my “landlord” and I need to respect her. This caused a huge fight between L and my mom. I’m the youngest and so my mom is very protective of me. My mom asked L to remove her name from the Deed. L refused to sign and told my mom she was dead to her. It took several weeks but things calmed down until March 2020. 

In March my moms health drastically declined. She was in the hospital/rehab for over a month. She is home now. Since admission to the hospital, L went insane. She told the hospital she was an only child and became my moms POA while my mom was unable to make decisions for herself. L refused to update me and my 2 other siblings on my moms progress and told nurses they weren’t allowed to speak with us. I called the hospital prior and they were shocked to find my mom had 3 more kids but they couldn’t do anything to help. This caused a huge fight between my 2 other siblings and myself against L. L again threatened to kick me out of my home. 

It is very stressful to think I could be thrown out of the home I’ve lived in my whole life. I understand with COVID-19 evictions cannot happen right now. I’m worried when this is over what will happen. My mom wants me to stay here. I am the primary caregiver to my mom and she needs me. It’s not good for my mental health knowing L could come here anytime she pleases, move in, or kick me out. Is there anything my mom and I can do to protect me? L and my mom are not speaking currently. A few days ago I had to call the police because L was screaming at my mom and refused to leave. L accused me of stealing from her. I do not have what she wants and I told her it’s somewhere in my moms room but I’m really not sure where. Things have been shuffled and moved around. The police told me they cannot make L leave because she is on the deed. 

I could move out but then the issue of who will take care of my mom comes up. I want to do what’s best for my mom because this may be her last few months. But I also know I need to take care of myself. I’m so stressed out I can’t eat or sleep because of L. She has a history of violence and so does her husband (he was in prison for attempted murder).

He had it with him earlier and moved it to the corner of the desk and I saw it earlier myself. I went to the office to make a complaint and ask to have it possibly even dropped back anonymously in our mail so I dont have to persue this. Yesterday charges just were made to some of his debit and credit cards. We already put out fraud alerts and such..... But I dont see this getting persued and want to have the person caught. My roomate who is like family is going to be getting into trouble and possibly a artical 15 at his job for losing the paperwork and military ID. Help?&lt;/p&gt;

She goes to great lengths to be away from her home. I know she sleeps in her car, only eats out, and only showers in gyms. (She asked to shower at my house since gyms are closed.

I have an opportunity for some small freelance work. Nothing major or full time. A couple hundred here and there. Some weeks it may add up to full time work.

Here's the elephant in the room: if I take this freelance work, it would go against what I get paid out in unemployment, and on certain weeks it may completely eradicate my weekly benefits. So if I make 600 or so a week, I would be ineligible to receive any amount of UI, including the extra 600. So I'm making less as a result, but I'm being productive and have opportunities to make money.

I am, however, worried that due to something vague in employment law, if I work enough, I will be considered fully ""self-employed"" and thus lose my benefits altogether when I really want to make extra cash and fully intend on going back to my job full-time once the furlough ends.

At this point it has made it's way inside on to the carpet and it just keeps getting worse.

Even if we were able to move everything out for a day, nothing is going to prevent the fleas from coming back inside. They need to treat the complex. When I mentioned that she said that she doesn't know if she can..???? It's a never ending cycle.

Hi, sorry if this is kinda vague. 

My family had some bad times a few years ago during which are old home “went under” and we couldn’t pay for it anymore. There was also a brief time in which my parents lived separately. During this time a man from my dad’s church offered him a home to rent since he was moving out anyways. He doesn’t pay for any house maintenance even though the house is literally falling apart with several broken windows, rotting support pillars, and peeling paint. There was a time in which the garage stopped working, and he didn’t want to pay for the repair. My dad has to literally ask him to help pay since my dad is a good renter and never missed payments, and that the renter could at least pay half. 

There wasn’t a contact agreement written or signed between the renter and my dad.

Do I have any leverage on this guy to report him to anything since it’s still *his* property but he refuses to maintain it despite renting it out? Is it even possible he that can be reported without them singing a contract together?

Edit: the broken windows are in my mom’s bedroom and those same windows also are above the patio. I’ve been told to not sit in certain areas since it’s at risk of if/when the glass breaks. The support pillars are made of wood and hold up the awning(?? for lack of a better word) above the main door.

I  passive aggressively told Sam to get in contact with this previous tenant and tell her to change all of the damn address; it been nearly 5 months! So my question is...is there anything I can do about this? Can I cut it up or something because my patience has completely evaporated? Im super new to the state and this situation so I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure where to even start. I also should note it&amp;#39;s the first time I&amp;#39;ve ever rented an apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi, I'm a horse and I'm in a bit of a bind at work.

I'm a ""salesman"" at work by title, but really I got delegated to take care of the sales legwork. I fill in orders, make sure they ship, fill out the required tax forms including a shipping label and commercial invoice, and do the same for when someone needs a part to repair our products or for whatever reason. These are often large orders of expensive machines across borders, usually from NY where I am to factories in China, Korea, or Japan, though the issue happens both internationally and when we ship nationally, usually to universities.

Until I left for corona leave, there was a woman who oversaw the whole process. Really I was easing her job, so she just knew how everything was done at my company. She always wanted me to give false values on the commercial invoices and other forms ""for tax reasons"" which I'm pretty sure is a sly way of saying ""so we can commit tax fraud."" These are often $100,000-200,000 products we list as $200, or at the very least $5,000 listed for $5. The second happens every day, the first more like monthly. I did this because it was a part of my job, but I made sure to let them know I'm uncomfortable with this and the only reason I'm doing it is because my overseer was always the one to put her signature on it, leaving me blameless (?). (Note: I think I'm on one or two of the earlier ones, before I realized that something sketchy is happening.) Well of course while I was gone they shat on her and she left. Now I'm going to be expected to do the same, but I don't want to break any laws for a sketchy company I don't even like.

Would I be held legally responsible for what I've done so far? 

Should I be turning these people in?

Who would prosecution go after? I actually like the woman who quit.

I've seen the IRS gives a reward for people who help with significant cases of tax fraud, is this something I can claim a reward on? Would I be incriminated to the point I could not get a reward? Am I looking at jail time?

I am considering sending an email to my idiot CEO when I get back basically saying ""I think what you're asking me to do is illegal, do I have to do it?"" I think he would send an email back saying ""yes or you're fired"" but I don't want to get too deep in this before I know what the legal situation is.

,legaladvice,"Short story: I’m living in the US in New York City under public housing. Neighbor from hell making my living atrocious for pass year/two. And I have no ideas on how to through living like this. Please help...

Pre-quarantine: A year ago every single day, the neighbor next door would knock on the door so damn loud that neighbors from the other side of the building would be able to hear it. You would think why I would be complaining about knocking but they actually knock for at least 30 minutes for the other person to open and it’s at 5AM in the morning, EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I’m not even exaggerating. The neighbor thst was living next to them yelled at the person knocking that he would break his door if he doesn’t stop. You think he would stop but nah. It just kept omg going on. And I’m pretty sure they drove that person away because I see a different person coming in and out of there now. Then for about a good 6-8 months after the other neighbor left, they occasionally blasting music late at night usually 12AM till the brick of dawn. And almost every weekend they allow their kids stay up all night running around stomping. I’ve contacted 311 countless dozen of times and all they said is that they filled out a noise complaint to the police and they will investigate during their off duty hours. (Or something along the lines of that).


Quarantine: They’ve got a pet dog. It’s not bad that they have a dog, I’m not complaining about that they got a dog. But I am complaining about his their dog ACTUALLY BARK FOR LITERAL HOURS AND THEY WON’T EVEN STOP AND CONTROL HIM/HER. Any time of the day, you name it the dog provides it, they won’t care. When the dog stops barking, it’s their cue to start blasting their music. 

I’ve texted one neighbor from the other side of the building if they could provide me some info to tone it down. He replied with 311 or housing management number. Otherwise, wear ear plugs. Apparently they have been letting their dog pee on their side of the building.

You would think why I would be complaining about knocking but they actually knock for at least 30 minutes for the other person to open and it’s at 5AM in the morning, EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I’m not even exaggerating. The neighbor thst was living next to them yelled at the person knocking that he would break his door if he doesn’t stop. You think he would stop but nah. It just kept omg going on. And I’m pretty sure they drove that person away because I see a different person coming in and out of there now. Then for about a good 6-8 months after the other neighbor left, they occasionally blasting music late at night usually 12AM till the brick of dawn. And almost every weekend they allow their kids stay up all night running around stomping. I’ve contacted 311 countless dozen of times and all they said is that they filled out a noise complaint to the police and they will investigate during their off duty hours. (Or something along the lines of that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quarantine: They’ve got a pet dog. It’s not bad that they have a dog, I’m not complaining about that they got a dog. But I am complaining about his their dog ACTUALLY BARK FOR LITERAL HOURS AND THEY WON’T EVEN STOP AND CONTROL HIM/HER. Any time of the day, you name it the dog provides it, they won’t care. When the dog stops barking, it’s their cue to start blasting their music. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve texted one neighbor from the other side of the building if they could provide me some info to tone it down. He replied with 311 or housing management number. Otherwise, wear ear plugs. Apparently they have been letting their dog pee on their side of the building.&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"I have an adult friend (21+) I have known for a few years. After confronting her parents over childhood abuse they had her committed. Her parents are very controlling and had her leave San Francisco County and stay at their house in San Jose. 

Her parents co own her condo in SF and have keys to her place, so they came over and convinced her to leave SF and go to SJ. Upon arriving in SJ they said she needed to take a bunch of meds and they called to get a prescription from her psych. The prescribed some sort of relaxing pill , and she told her doctor she does not consent to taking this. 

So after a day at her parents house she told them she wants to go home to SF and they said no. During a car ride she asked for them to let her out of the car and they restrained her and said she couldn’t leave 

Upon the end of the car ride she gets back to her parents house and eats a meal prepared by her parents. She falls asleep and wakes up a few hours later. 

When she wakes up she again asks to leave their house in SJ. They say no. She says I want to go to the hospital , they said no. So she decides to tell them she’s feeling suicidal and if they don’t take her to the hospital she will kill herself. She said she wrote a suicide note. She says this was a lie and no note was ever written 

So they called the police and the cops came. My friend is adamant she started to comply. The police asked her if she was ok and she said I want to go to the hospital to escape my parents. Then the police said ok are you ready to go and she said yes. So the officer said , What drugs have you taken if any? Friend says no, and then her mom chimes in “ she took an anti psychotic”. My friend told the police she never took that and told the officer she expressly didn’t consent and she asked the officer “is that legal? Can she drug me”

The cop said it’s legal if it’s prescribed. At this point she still thought this was a joke being played on her by her parents. 

So then she was admitted to the hospital, and eventually they wrote that they found a suicide note. She was kept at the hospital for 7 days for paranoia and delusions. During the stay she kept saying I wasn’t suicidal but her families input said she is delusional. 

After she is released she goes home to her apartment which her parents and her own. 

At this point her parents have said they will randomly come and do home checks on her, without her consent. She is worried that if her parents begin contacting her therapist and psychiatrist again, they will be able to have have her committed once again . 

What are her options to make sure her parents do not harass her anymore in her apartment? She is not manic or delusional or a harm to herself no others- what should she do? I suggested she change her locks and file a police report detailing her parents harassing behavior.

,legaladvice,"Hey everyone,

I'm trying to figure out what to do in regards to purchasing a new motorcycle.  In the state of Georgia, it is illegal for a dealership to advertise the price of a vehicle and then tack on extra fees such as dealership fees and whatnot.  Only government fees can be added afterwards. The links to the law can be found in several locations here from the state:

I called the governors office and they said I can file a report on each dealership but they only act if either A) I have a contract showing they added fees afterwards or B) they get so many alerts from people that shows a trend. 

My question is, what would ya'll do?  Do I just suck it up, pay the fees and then go argue it in small claims court since the law is on my side?  How can I get the state to enforce their own laws or even the dealership to see reason?  Apparently every dealership is still doing this.

,legaladvice,"For context, I am a foreign student in the UK. I received my unconditional letter in June, and applied for student halls once registration opened about week later.
Now, I wanted to get a job to pay for my accommodation, food, etc (being from outside the UK I wasn't eligible for maintenance grants), so I decided to move to the UK a month prior to University starting (on 20th Sep 2014) so I could get a job before all the students got there and applied for them. So I booked a flight for the 13th of August 2014.
My student halls wouldn't accept students moving in prior to the 20th of September, so I needed a place to stay for the period between arriving at England and moving into the halls. 
By late July, however, I still hadn't had a definitive answer as to whether my application for the Halls had been successful, so as a precautionary measure, I contacted several landlords, mentioning I'd need a place for this short period prior to 20th Sep. but could possibly need it for the entire year should my application fall through.
I exchanged a couple of emails with a landlord who was happy to oblige. So I arrive on 13th, they ask me for the rent for the entire month plus bills. Cash. There and then. I told them I could only take so much from an ATM daily so I could give them 2/3 now and the rest at a later date. They said OK, I handed the money, they then made me sign the tenancy agreement (more on that in a bit) and I asked to write me an invoice (my dad had drilled it into my 18yo skull, and I can't thank him enough for it). They were quite reluctant as hadn't brought anything to do it but eventually produced an invoice pad from their car, hand wrote one for the amount, gave it to me and left. 
2 days later, I received confirmation of my place at Uni Halls from 20th Sep on, at which time I contact the landlord via phone, let them know and we agree the next time they come down I'll pay the remaining rent for the month + bills for the month. The 2nd (last) invoice I got read 'Balance of rent + part (or ract? It was mostly unintelligible) payment bills'. On the 20th of Sep I move into halls and post my key through the letterbox as they couldn't come and collect it so told me to do this. 

Congratulations for making it through that huge wall of exposition, but we're here now. 6 years later, in the midst of a pandemic and I receive 2 letters from a debt collection agency claiming I owe them gas + electricity for the period of 13/08/2014 - 05/07/2015.
Now, obviously I haven't lived there for this period of time, and I obtained confirmation from my University in writing to state I was contracted with them during these dates, but this raises a couple of questions.

If that is true, am I liable for this bill even though I contacted my landlord and we agreed on a final figure, but didn't sign any further documentation on? (like a termination of the agreement)

2) If we're being pragmatic, there's slim chance a student is renting a property WHILST being simmultaneously contracted with student halls, but I'm not sure if proof that I wasn't living at that address at the time is sufficient to sustain my claim that I should not be liable for these bills.


I'm sure there's things I've forgotten to mention which may be of use to know, like for example I do not have access to the tenancy agreement now, but I still have in my possession the invoices.

Anything else that comes up I'll make sure to update this accordingly.

I received my unconditional letter in June, and applied for student halls once registration opened about week later.
Now, I wanted to get a job to pay for my accommodation, food, etc (being from outside the UK I wasn&amp;#39;t eligible for maintenance grants), so I decided to move to the UK a month prior to University starting (on 20th Sep 2014) so I could get a job before all the students got there and applied for them. So I booked a flight for the 13th of August 2014.
My student halls wouldn&amp;#39;t accept students moving in prior to the 20th of September, so I needed a place to stay for the period between arriving at England and moving into the halls. 
By late July, however, I still hadn&amp;#39;t had a definitive answer as to whether my application for the Halls had been successful, so as a precautionary measure, I contacted several landlords, mentioning I&amp;#39;d need a place for this short period prior to 20th Sep. but could possibly need it for the entire year should my application fall through.
I exchanged a couple of emails with a landlord who was happy to oblige. So I arrive on 13th, they ask me for the rent for the entire month plus bills. Cash. There and then. I told them I could only take so much from an ATM daily so I could give them 2/3 now and the rest at a later date. They said OK, I handed the money, they then made me sign the tenancy agreement (more on that in a bit) and I asked to write me an invoice (my dad had drilled it into my 18yo skull, and I can&amp;#39;t thank him enough for it). They were quite reluctant as hadn&amp;#39;t brought anything to do it but eventually produced an invoice pad from their car, hand wrote one for the amount, gave it to me and left. 
2 days later, I received confirmation of my place at Uni Halls from 20th Sep on, at which time I contact the landlord via phone, let them know and we agree the next time they come down I&amp;#39;ll pay the remaining rent for the month + bills for the month. The 2nd (last) invoice I got read &amp;#39;Balance of rent + part (or ract? It was mostly unintelligible) payment bills&amp;#39;. On the 20th of Sep I move into halls and post my key through the letterbox as they couldn&amp;#39;t come and collect it so told me to do this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations for making it through that huge wall of exposition, but we&amp;#39;re here now. 6 years later, in the midst of a pandemic and I receive 2 letters from a debt collection agency claiming I owe them gas + electricity for the period of 13/08/2014 - 05/07/2015.
Now, obviously I haven&amp;#39;t lived there for this period of time, and I obtained confirmation from my University in writing to state I was contracted with them during these dates, but this raises a couple of questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) It&amp;#39;s possible I signed the tenancy agreement for the whole year, since as I mentioned, I hadn&amp;#39;t had confirmation. Perhaps I shouldn&amp;#39;t, but hey, hindsight. If that is true, am I liable for this bill even though I contacted my landlord and we agreed on a final figure, but didn&amp;#39;t sign any further documentation on? (like a termination of the agreement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) If we&amp;#39;re being pragmatic, there&amp;#39;s slim chance a student is renting a property WHILST being simmultaneously contracted with student halls, but I&amp;#39;m not sure if proof that I wasn&amp;#39;t living at that address at the time is sufficient to sustain my claim that I should not be liable for these bills.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi All,

I had a question regarding potential legal pitfalls of venture I am considering undertaking. I am a university student, and for the past semester have been working on a software project in a small group for a class. For the final deliverable, we produced a working prototype of the software, and after demonstrating the idea to professors, friends, and family, I decided that I would be really interested in moving forward with the project beyond the class and attempting to release the software, with the possibility of incorporating monetization somehow. I talked to my friend in the group and he felt the same way.

However, we would like to keep the other two group members uninvolved in the continuation of the project. They quite frankly did not contribute very much during the semester, and my friend and I strongly believe that we would work much better without them. In fact, if they had to be involved for any reason I would rather forego working on this project and spend my time elsewhere. In terms of contributions, the other two members only completed one or two mock business elements for the class and a few slides on our final pitch deck. Neither of them contributed any code that made it into the submitted deliverable, and contributed &lt;20 lines each in total throughout the semester (and yes, the project in total was thousands of lines of code). I did a vast majority of the code, while my friend handled the designs, wire-frames, asset creation, and a bunch of the business stuff.

Bottom line is that the two of us would like to continue working on this project beyond the scope of our class which is now over, but we want to cut out two of the group members who didn't contribute much despite being ask to several times and given many opportunities to do so in multiple areas. However, we wouldn't want this to come back and bite us in the rear, legally speaking, if we were to publish the software especially if we monetize it. Ethically speaking we are totally fine with the situation since the other members were very hard to deal with and earnestly did not contribute, but we don't want to get sued or anything (we both live in the United States if that makes a difference). Are there any considerations we need to take if we move forward, or is this something that we should not do unless everyone is working on it?

TLDR: Want to publish software made as part of a university project and potentially monetize it. Also want to cut out half of the group from the class who didn't contribute.

So I ordered from a company and way after their already extended timeline I reached out to find out what's going on. I waited until way after their customer response timeline, nothing. I reached out by email and 3 different social media sites. I called the number on their website just to be given another number by an automated message, calling that one and finding out its down right now. At this point I had had enough and so I canceled payment with the bank. I messaged them again through multiple channels to let them know I had done so. All of a sudden I get a message back on Instagram from them and the rep tries to buy me off with ""expedited shipping"" (already signed up from 1-3 days shipping before) and a free ashtray, but I could cancel still if I wanted to. I, again,told them I had already canceled with my bank and I wanted this order canceled on their end too. The rep doesn't respond. Later at 9pm I get an email saying my order has shipped! The next day the rep says ""Oh sorry it's shipped now so it cant be canceled"" That was last week, I checked the tracking and they've only printed the label but its still there in their warehouse and hasn't been touched by USPS. I have time stamped screen shots of all of this.

I'll refuse the package if I get the chance but its often delivered when I'm not here (although lately I am) or just delivered at the top of the driveway by the mailbox since its a very steep hill and I have no idea until I pick up the mail later that anything has arrived.

,legaladvice,"I worked at a large bank for nearly 3 years. I was exceptional in sales goals, customer service, and never once disciplined for any reason during this time. I was promoted 3 times. 


In March 2020, I decided to file an HR complaint on my branch manager. The company requires us as employees to report possible illegal or unethical behavior. I was moving to a new role which involved traveling and would soon not work under the manager. I knew of inappropriate behaviors and sexual encounters between a banker, mortgage rep, district manager, and teller, and heavy favoritism based on romantic reciprocation. Those behaviors had become extreme when I decided to report. I hesitated for a time due to the potential of retaliation. The teller did not reciprocate and in turn was not treated as well. My complaint mentioned this and other well known details by others so I could remain as annonymous as possible. The manager and myself had been friends as I did not want to give myself a difficult work life, but his behavior on countless occasions was not appropriate and often sexually driven. 


When i spoke to an HR investigator about the treatment of others, issues of favoritism, and an inappropriate work relationship, the investigator seemed only interested in the excessive gifts the manager bought a coworker he was romantically interested in. He had twiced asked her to go on a date with him and admitted so, when that is strictly against bank policy due to conflict of interest. I knew this coworker was not romantically interested in return but didn't want her exceptional treatment to change. It was found that the manager was written up for the gifts. In banking, gifts to clients, coworkers, or mortgage partners insinuates possible bribary, legal issues, and unfair treatment. 


This bank also has an extensive ethics policy handbook that can be found online. Early on it preaches the ""do the right thing"" and ensures anonymity(when possible) as well as a zero tolerance policy for employees who are retaliated against for filing a report. The HR investigator I first spoke with told me to reach out to the regional HR representative if I experienced retaliation.


Somehow my identity was known only days after the report and the manager as well as other coworkers were extremely upset for me blowing the whistle. I was treated terribly and excessively micro managed which I had never experienced before. I was scolded and asked to forge paperwork(i believe was an attempt to fire me then but i refused) I documented the incidents that were blatantly wrong with the witnesses and forwarded them to the regional HR rep, as instructed when you experience retaliation. I then speak with another HR rep who doubted my allegations, but all were confirmed by other employees who witnessed some. Weeks pass and the treatment continued to an unbearable level, and I began to take anxiety medication to cope and even told the HR rep I had clinical depression and anxiety and the hostile environment was becoming too much to for me. 


I then was told I was being forced to relocate to another branch this manager also manages 50% of the time. It was not the branch I had applied for and I planned on working. It was then I emailed the regional HR a final time saying I felt nothing was being done and I would not tolerate the retaliatory treatment any longer. I also explained the manager has had many sexual relationships at work and also made me uncomfortable on numerous occasions. I then got a final call from a 3rd HR rep who asked more about the sexual misconduct/harrassment. I gave her names of witnesses and people who knew or saw the same things I did. This was never followed up on. I asked one coworker who experienced inappropiate sexual conduct if she was reached out to, and she told me she was not. It is my understanding all companies are required to in good faith investigate all sexual harrassment claims regardless of their feelings on probability of the incidents. This did not happen and this bank claims to follow through on such claims in addition to retaliation. From what I have read, most companies lose lawsuits by default when they don't investigate protected activities correctly.


I moved to my new role and location and would still see this manager in passing but we did not speak. I felt things were improving but I was also on a project that didn't involve interaction with him. During my first HR investigator call, I sent text messages and work messages supporting my early claim. After the complaint of retaliation I was never asked for more evidence nor for any regarding sexual misconduct. I was asked for names and the bank did not ask those individuals about the accusation. 


On Wednesday April 29, the company sent a mass email to all employees putting dollar amounts on gift giving, I am assuming because of my original HR complaint.

No one was ever disciplined regarding my complaint(less a minor write-up) but instead the company revised its policy. On Friday, May 1st, the district manager came in at the end of my shift and put me on a conference call with the regional HR representative. In a minute or less, she told me I was being terminated as the investigation was closed and they found I complained in bad faith. She also added I had said unkind things about coworkers but did not say who or when. For months I had kept to myself and always treated my coworkers with respect while we worked together. Had they fired me for any other reason(as a model employee they could not find anything it seems), I know I would be screwed due to being an at-will state.

I am seeking your advice and help as when I draw this map together, I realize none of this would have happened if I didn't ""whistleblow"".... The sequence of events I believe proves this as well as ignoring a sexual harrassment allegation and well documented retaliation. I see a huge issue after reading state and federal guidelines for whistleblowing/sexual harrassment/retaliation and see a large difference here vs a typical Nevada at will termination. I made reasonable attempts with my employer through the proper channels and policy to correct this, and the employer responded negatively and retalitory.

I was moving branches and had nothing to gain from saying anything...i have plenty of proof of my allegations...my goal was to protect future employees and create a fair environment for the ones there. My employer without a doubt in my mind can't prove I reported in bad faith, and I was ultimately let go for whistleblowing and being a liability if these behaviors continued.

I am seeking impartial advice about legal recourse. Do i have a case? Does it fall under whistleblower, retaliation, or sexual harrassment protections?

,legaladvice,"So I've been working on this new app called Wonolo. It allows you to take all sorts of different jobs as an independent contractor.

I did a bunch of jobs at a big pharmacy chain. At most of the jobs the staffing agency that sends me there never informed the store I was coming nor were they aware that such staffing agency even existed and there usually isn't much work to be done.

On most occasions, the managers would send everyone home early. There isn't enough work to be done in a small store for the employees so they generally can't find things for three extra people to do for 6 and a half hours.

Now, in the app, jobs are usually advertised as a flat day rate pay. I have seen jobs advertising an hourly pay, but all the ones I've taken were the flat day rate.

In this case, the job was advertised as $97.50 total pay. Nowhere else was there any indication that pay would be hourly. Generally, the staffing agency had been paying me in full.

Now, the last four jobs that I've completed for them they've begun to pay me less than what was advertised.

This is the latest response I got from Wonolo:

""When you sign up for the app, you accept the Terms of Use that state you are an independent contractor. Please see Section 3.

 

As an independent contractor, Wonoloers may be paid by the hour the same rate, no matter how many hours he or she works; is not covered by the employer’s workers’ compensation insurance, and may shoulder additional tax burdens. 

 

It also states therein that ""Wonolo does not pay a salary or hourly rate but rather facilitates Requestor’s payment of the rate set by the Requestor;""

 

Since the job that you accepted at *staffing agency* had a disclaimer ""We will be validating payment off of the store timesheets."",   this implied payment is in accordance to the amount of time spent on each job.

 

Though it may not have explicitly indicated an hourly pay but it was clear from the disclaimer alone that payment is subject to confirmation or validation, depending on the timesheet information. This would justify accurate payment for a Wonoloer who worked 1 hour against one who worked for 6 hours.

I've always had bad luck with women, and when they come in my life I try everything not to lose them. I've even been often times questioning my sexuality. Maybe I try so hard with keeping people around because these women are my ""beards"" Idk. Some more background too is that I started at a 4 year college then took a year off, after having a mental breakdown and attempting suicide which resulted in a being placed in a pysch ward. A huge issue I have is saying no to people, and just in general being too nice. Also this is in New York.

Not that the background is out of the way. Basically a few years ago this whole nightmare started a few years back, I matched with this really pretty girl on Tinder. We talked for a little bit, and I ended up taking her on a couple dates. She gave me a blowjob (Which I didn't get hard for) and I went down on her. A few months later I got a phone call from her dad and literally my stomach dropped so far when he told me her daughter was underage (15). This happened when I was 22. A couple months later she reached out to me again and apologized. We were talking and this girl is really intelligent. we just kept being friends which was not smart on my part at all. I later went back to college and I started seeing another women who is my now girlfriend and is amazing. But this is the part that's really bad. The underage girl was now 16 by now. She starts this off by telling me ""I want to send you a pic, but I can't"". and me being an idiot I tell her go for it. She sends me an underwear picture. 

This caused the situtation to spiral like crazy. Basically we sent nudes literally all the time while I was dating my girlffriend. I was even sending nudes to guys. (I've talked to my girlfriend about some of this). It was really bad, I didn't realize it but I was kinda grooming her. Which is awful, I just thought I was being nice and we were having fun. This went on for 4 months. It didn't stop until her friend called me up and told me how much of a piece of shit I was being. It took that to make realize, and take a step back. 

I thought that I did enough to protect myself. I deleted all social media and blocked her from my laptop (I have a mac). But not on my phone. Now this girl has contacted just recently a few times. Since quarentine has started maybe 5. (She follows my girlfriend on instagram, so the calls typically come when my girlfriend makes a post. Ususaly I ignore the calls since they're really late at night. But I picked up one, last month and she calling me a sexual predator, and that I was the adult. And really laying into me about it about how much of a garbage person I am.  She called again last night, I picked it up and talked to her. She told me how she learned the grooming and that i groomed her. (which is disgusting). She told me about how she was thinking of messaging my girlfriend about everything. But what I'm getting to is she told me she talked to people and she told me what charges I could be looking at. She said she isn't sure about pressing charges. I want both the girl and I to be at peace. I told her that.

What my question is, is what can I do to protect myself? I've told my best friend everything. I didn't try to sugarcoat anything. He really recommended I stop contact. A

# Pregnancy and relationship

📷

Thankyou to whoever is taking time to read it. Its long but precise enough to help me with some advice.

I had a relationship with my ex for two years and we broke up due to some family issues. After a while he lied to me and it was all for another girl. I started drinking with my friends and one day( July 2019) I met one of my friends friend ABC. (I will keep the name ABC to avoid identity bad mouthing). I kinda liked him and started flirting (even though I wasn't over my ex- my first mistake). ABC look quite disturbed and eventually he shared what was wrong with him. He had financial issues has his Immigration status was going to expire. He was short of 3000$ and I started trusting him so much in few days that I made an arrangement for the money he was short. In a few days he had issues with his roommates and he moved out. I asked him to come to my place. My ex and I share a dog in common and he use to come visit him. So whenever he use to come I asked ABC to sleep outside because I didn't want my ex to think ill of me. In a way I mistreated ABC. One day two of my friends came to see me from far and we went for dinner and it was too late for them to drive home. So I asked them to sleep at mine. They came and ABC thought I slept with one of them which I didn't. He started having character issues with me and meanwhile during that process I started realizing my mistakes and fell In love with him. He started getting abusive day by day, violent, humiliated me in front of his friends, even showed his pe\*\*s out of his pants in front of his friends and asked me to have it if I am too much into sex. I still continued facing all that because of the guilt I had for mistreating him. Me and ABC weren't dating and it was all physical because he wasn't interested In me. Dec 2020 we had unprotected intercourse, and Feb 2020 2nd week I got to know I am pregnant. I was ready to abort it but was waiting for some financial support from back home. mean while I had an ultrasound and got attached to the baby and didn't wanted to end the pregnancy . I told ABC about it and gave him full assurity that he would never even have to pay a penny for the child. But he started calling me names like prostitute, child eater and stuff like that. Now he is forcing me to abort or he will make my life hell. What should I do. I am getting depressed and helpless day by day. He sleeps in my room and I sleep on the stairs. I am just too scared to hear those words again. He even said that he never enjoyed getting physical with me( after 9 months ) and he just did it so I wouldn't go to any other guy. He says I planned pregnancy against his will. I have appoitment proof for abortion, pictures of injuries from his abuse but do not want to get him in trouble because I love him. I do not want to loose my child at any cost. I asked him that I will sign the papers that you won't be liable about anything but he is not listening.

So I’m buying a townhome. Closing date all set and signed by both parties on addendum.  Well, cabinet makers were shutdown for a short time and now it’s changing my closing date from (22nd) to later the following month (02nd). 

They are trying to get me to sign the addendum, and relieve themselves of any thing extra costs associated with me being displaced or my belongings.

They have tried telling me that I should get an Airbnb, hotel and other things that would be coming out of my pocket, as well as a storage facility or pod for temporary storage needs.

The townhome is new construction and they are doing things to get it all ready in time and even asked to sign a zero day walk and they would come fix later.

The sales person/realtor just dumped me after papers were signed and haven’t heard from them, but the others are picking up their slack.

I’ve been walking the house and giving them a list of items that need correcting so there isn’t a list for this zero day walk they are proposing.

,legaladvice,"So I lived in an apartment in Los Angeles, CA during 2018-2019. My girlfriend was the main signer of the lease, with her mom as a guarantor, and I was on the lease as occupant. The first apartment manager working there was very chill, lenient with the rules. Super nice guy. The parking in the building was paid PER CAR, and open parking, meaning no assigned spots. You paid monthly for your parking pass, and parked anywhere in the garage. The apartment manager gave me a garage gate key, and told me not to worry about paying the extra parking fee. I had never paid this fee, I guess he thought my girlfriend paying for her one spot was enough money spent for the both of us to park there. Like I said, really chill guy. 

The problem arises after we moved out. I had parked in the garage throughout the entire duration of the lease. A situation happened where the original manager was fired, a new manager took over, and corporate managers started heavily managing the building. This was a mess. Everything changed. The living situation became uncomfortable and we even got them to agree to cutting our lease short because of all of the problems we were having there, but we didn't end up moving out early because of the headache. So we stayed throughout the lease duration. 

After we left, everything seemed fine. About a week later, a ludicrous bill comes in for painting fees and overdue parking fees. We contested the painting fees, as we have a walkthrough on video of the manager saying everything looked fine and they even marked down a chart saying there would be minimal fees for screw holes in the wall. The unpaid and overdue parking fees came as a huge confusion. I was told not to worry about it! I was given a parking garage gate key and was never once asked to pay the parking fee while living there!

Now without contacting us much about the bill, they have sent the parking bill to collections, under my girlfriend and her mothers name. They knew the parking bill was because of my car. I was on the lease as an occupant. They have my information. I believe they're specifically going after the stronger party who holds more money and assets on purpose. On top of sending it to collections during a global pandemic, which I suspect is because they're down money on rent because tenants can't pay and they know they can't do anything about that. 

I'm asking for advice on what to do here. Does this bill need to be paid? Is this legal for them to do? They sent it to collections with minimal contact to us, from my understanding.

,legaladvice,"Hello,

Feb 16th I called COMPANY tech support because my laptop would not power on. The rep walked me through taking off the back plate and disconnecting the battery. While doing so, I cut my finger on the battery connector and bled around the connector. I told this to the woman and she apologized and told me she would escalate the repair and have a technician come repair it.

Days went by and the woman asks for pictures of the blood and cut finger. These were sent. Many go by and I have no answer on the warranty. I call and I’m told I will need to send a photo of the service tag and some information. Unfortunately by this time I have begun my move to another state and leave the $3000 paper weight behind. My previous boss and family friend takes the proof photo(as if the bloody one and finger weren’t enough) and sends it to them. They do not check the email and close the case while I was too busy setting up in my new home and dealing with a global pandemic. They emailed stating it was “archived”.

The laptop is worth south of $3000. And is really an important investment in my new business. I’m saving to get a new one but cannot continue my work until I do.

I said “well I might as well have aids” to the phone rep in an sarcastic manner considering how they were treating it as a biohazard. One other rep told me I was lying to Company because I said my laptop would be delivered in NEW STATE after I moved, however because of the virus I had to cancel those plans over fear of transmission to me or my RELATIVE who would be shipping the device but currently is undergoing chemo and shouldn’t expose herself.

I do believe I let my temper get the best of my after month two and I had to apologize for raising my voice over the phone, though I never insulted anyone nor talked poorly about the product. The laptop was covered under warranty and it took COMPANY months to give me an answer. I also injured myself while following instructions from a phone rep.

,legaladvice," Six years ago when I was young and naive, I got talked into financing a $30,000 car. I remember being shocked at how easy and fast the financing process was, as I initially thought I’d get denied due to my bad credit and low income. During the whole entire car buying process I was not asked for, nor did I provide any type of identification, proof of insurance, proof of residency, or proof of income. I was given a one page application to fill, talked for a bit, signed a contract and drove off. Being as this was my first time buying a new car, I guess I let my excitement of getting approved outweigh my skepticism of the whole experience.
About a year passes and I receive a call from my mother (whom I haven’t lived with in years) saying that Bayport Credit Union called her and said they put a forced coverage on my car (due to accidental 30 day lapse in insurance). I then proceed to call Bay Port CU, and during this conversation Im asked if I’m still employed as an electrician, at this shipyard two hours away from where I was living. This was extremely odd to me as it wasn’t even close to what I put on my application (waiting tables). For the next ten months I had to pay an additional three hundred a month  on top of my car payment.. another 6 months later and I couldn’t do it anymore so I told them to come get my car. 
After they repossessed my car I checked my credit report and discovered that they have falsely reported 9 different late payments in a years time. I have (and still do) bank statements proving all 9 of those payments were on time as I had reoccurring bill pay set up.

I've recently lost a bike that was tied to my balcony (I'm on the first floor). This happened while I was asleep at night, during the shelter-in-place period. It's almost impossible for someone to reach and grab from the outside of the balcony - someone has to have jumped over the fence and then grab it. I do live in a gated community (so it's gated, and then I have a 6ft tall wall around the balcony). I don't feel safe living in this unit anymore so I have tried to contact the leasing office to transfer to another unit but they have failed to respond back to me for 3 weeks.

Due to increase in thefts and car break-ins due to economy pitfall, I'm pretty confident more thefts will happen. What really concerns me is though there is no surveillance system to the gate of the community, and the balcony door is very.. balcony-door-ish. Meaning it has a huge square-glass in the middle that anyone can break in. It was not really a problem when I moved in, but now I actually experienced burglary, I do feel little unsafe and the leasing office has done no effort to do accommodate. Actually, even before trying to accommodate, they have ignored my calls and when they picked up and said the manager will get back to me, she never did. I don't even know if she got the message tbh. Can this be suitable for uninhabitable situation? I'm ultimately trying to break the lease without penalty and move out of this community.

Hello,

My 18-month deferred prosecution agreement is set to expire in mid-June. I believe I did everything correctly, and I sent in all of my paperwork (proof of counseling, mental health evaluation, etc.) to the district attorney's office, more specifically their deferred prosecution department. Part of the agreement is not committing anything above a Class C moving traffic offense, which I have avoided.

I can't help but notice that I may have gotten an assessment about a week late, although I am not even sure if the stipulation applies to my conditions because it is much further down in the agreement. I am freaking out, but I don't know if I am being irrational.

After sending my documents to the DA's office, I was told that they had received my documents and that they would do a final review for compliance on the due date. I can contact them for my case status after the due date. They also reminded me that I cannot commit another offense leading up to the mid-June due date.

My main question is: would they have informed me if I had violated the deferred prosecution agreement when I sent in all of my paperwork? Am I in the clear as long as I do commit another offense until the due date?

If you don't know the answer, do you know of where I could go to find the answer to this? Any other suggestions to where I could go for help?

I feel pretty desperate and anxious, so I'll really appreciate any help/advice/answers you have to offer.

,legaladvice,"Hello! I hope this is the right place.

So, pre-COVID I was working 32-40 hours at a small company. During COVID, I had my hours cut to 25 hours a week, so I applied for partial unemployment (Texas Workforce Commission) because 25 hours a week is not enough to cover my bills and medical bills.

It’s been ALMOST long enough to finally request the actual unemployment (my filing day is Wednesday), but I just got word today that one of the higher ups at the company I work for is going to contest my application, and they’re going to say that I actually worked 39 hours this week and next week on my next check (next week Friday), even though I only worked 25 hours. I’m assuming so that it seems like I’m actually full time to TWC. They also informed me that after this pay period (Friday), they’re putting me back down to part-time at 30 hours, which still is barely under what I can comfortably live on. They’re acting like they’re doing me a favor, but it’s very obvious they’re doing this so I can’t collect partial unemployment. In fact, I’m not the only employee they’re doing this too. In addition, they informed me that I’ll receive extra duties, alongside all the extra duties I’ve received since I’ve been working from home. They let go my coworker a few weeks ago as soon as this started, so I’ve basically picked up the work of two people at almost half the hours.

What the hell can I do? Partial unemployment allows me to reliably live on what I’m making part-time, handle my bills, etc. I was already living check-to-check before, so even a 10-15 hours decrease is a good amount of money in my situation.

Apologies if this isn't tagged properly, I was unsure which one was most relevant.

I purchased this car in December of 2019. In March, a distracted driver slammed into my car at 40 mph, totalling it.

When I bought the car, they assured that they would obtain the title within 31 days (The law in my state requires this for any sales.) After 60 days and several weeks of expired temp tags, we went to the dealership to check on the progress. They had made no effort at all to obtain the title. And almost refused to give us new temporary tags as ""That's not really how that's supposed to work.""
Then in April we visit again, asking where the title is. They showed us records of contact they had made to obtain it. They made a handful of phone calls and payments over a month after that 60 day meeting. Promised they would have it by the end of the month. May comes, still no title. I call the dealership, and the manager had heard nothing about my situation. The finance manager we spoke with before had either been keeping it under wraps, or they were both lying to cover themselves.

Meanwhile I've been racking up late fees on my auto loan and taking a credit hit because I can't keep paying for a car that 
1) Is no longer drivable/in my possession 
2) Isn't legally mine despite having put thousands into it already.

Yesterday, they finally obtained the title for my car and my insurance can begin to move forward. After their coverage, I am still out $2,500 on a car I was able to use for 2 months.
I paid roughly 18% of the total value of the car as a down payment, and had only made my first monthly payment at the time of the accident.

Do I have any options, here? The dealership sold me a car they didn't have the title to, and made no effort to obtain said title for over 90 days after the purchase, leading to a holdup with my insurance and settling my auto loan.

Do I just take the loss and move on?

As the title says, my boss mentors prisoners and helps them out quite a bit if they do get released. One of these guys, located in Texas, recently got out and married a women he had met while he was incarcerated. Unsurprisingly, they're having issues and he now wants a divorce. According to him,  she is running up debt in his name, so he wants to do something that would insure he's not on the hook for that debt. He sent a letter to my boss, who then passed it on to me, to get it placed in their local newspaper (my boss and I are not in Texas). The letter basically states that after March 31st he will not be held liable for any debt incurred under his name. He also states that the divorce is declared April 26th and she has 20 days to respond to the ad or all community property is given to him.

,legaladvice,"Hi all.

I bought a house in Texas in 2018. We got home owner's insurance before purchasing and our roof is covered under our policy based on their inspection, which did not identify a shingle overlay.

We have had some issues with the roof leaking in the past couple months but we shrugged that off thinking it wasn't anything major. We had the leak repaired and didn't think too much of it at the time.

However, due to my job, I had inside information on a company that redid my roof in 2016. I know the job description (take off old shingles, put on new shingles, and some interior paint work), invoice number, address (matched mine, hey!), cost, previous home owner's name (already knew that but it matched) on the invoice, roofing company's name, etc. It is part of my job to review contracts, so I know for a fact a roofing job of taking off old shingles and putting on new shingles took place in 2016 in the home I live in today. This information is considered confidential and admitting it would affect employment.

When I purchased the home, the inspector stated no issues with the roof (minor wear and tear), but mostly that the gutters needed work. At the time, the paperwork stated the roof was 5 years old. This is not considered old for a roof (had no knowledge of said invoice at the time).

Recently, we were able to hire a contractor for the gutters. The contractor admitted the gutters were bad, then stated our roof had a non-working ventilator (specifically listed in the invoice I saw to create/fix), and had new shingles placed on top of old shingles, thus voiding the warranty of the new shingles and making the roof ""out of code"". Since I (confidentially) saw a contract for the roofing job and the price, I thought this person was trying to pull something on us. He was pushy about having our insurance cover replacing roof and gutters (there was mild hail damage) and we pay the deductible. We explained our roof was only \~5 years old, to which he was confident it was older. Knowing our roof was not the plan, with a contractor this pushy, we sought other contractors.

After a few other calls, it felt like every contractor asked about our roof with no regard to our actual needs. I found a friendly contractor and asked: if these claims were made against your roof, and your mortgage contract said otherwise, what would you do? The sale of the new roof was under the previous owner's name, so I'm not sure I'd be able to contact the roofer. His advice was to contact the real estate agent. Okay.

The second person who inspected our roof for gutter repair mentioned, unprompted, the same concerns about our roof: it's out of code, there were shingles on shingles, this voids the warranty, etc.

I called my realtor, explained the situation, and told her that I confidentially knew that there was a sale on the roof of my house with very specific instructions that have been contradicted by two independent contractors quickly on inspecting my house. I explained I couldn't disclose that info, but that if I could find the name of the roofing agency by honest means, we could pursue accordingly.

The price charged (over double a typical roof of my slant/size) made me think the old owner was being scammed, and I was paying the price.

When my realtor reviewed the files, it said our roof was 5 years old. The old owners lived there 3 years and (when recently asked) claimed there was no work done on the roof during their ownership, yet when they purchased the house, the documentation from prior owners stated it was 7 years old. Meaning when they sold the house, 7 + 3 =10. Why didn't they claim a 10 year old roof? Why did they say it was 5 years old?

I asked my realtor if maybe I had bad info, that the owner had rental properties, and the invoice I saw was for a rental property but billed to that address. She checked, he didn't. My realtor suggested that it was possibly insurance fraud, since the cost was so high, the work contradicted the invoice, and the roof magically got younger during their time living at that address.

I looked at the company's Google reviews, and saw a review from the same name as the previous owner of my house, at the company I know did the roofs, about the time and date that my roof was redone (The review is currently listed as 3 years old) talking about how great the roofers were, and how they double checked everything \*before the insurance agent arrived\*. 

This owner is claiming no roof repairs were done to this house during his ownership which would be from 2015 to 2018, however his review indicates he hired a roofing company in 2016-2017 to do some work on the roof due to insurance issues, was 5 stars satisfied with the result.

How do we proceed? Based on the fact that the previous owner left a review of a roofing company mentioning work was done on his roof, but has told us that no work was performed on the roof while he owned the property, I feel that we have been misled about the state of the property when we purchased it. Should we contact a lawyer to proceed, contact our insurance company, or contact the roofing company? Based on the owners reply so far I don't feel he will be giving honest information so I need some help moving forward so that I can resolve this issue.",t2_6f9qz39q,False,,0,False,(TX) Our roof was part of an insurance scam before we bought the home.,[],r/legaladvice,False,6,,0,False,t3_gg9yqm,False,dark,0.91,,public,16,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,16,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1589032722.0,text,6,,,text,self.legaladvice,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all.&lt;/p&gt;

I know the job description (take off old shingles, put on new shingles, and some interior paint work), invoice number, address (matched mine, hey!), cost, previous home owner&amp;#39;s name (already knew that but it matched) on the invoice, roofing company&amp;#39;s name, etc. It is part of my job to review contracts, so I know for a fact a roofing job of taking off old shingles and putting on new shingles took place in 2016 in the home I live in today. This information is considered confidential and admitting it would affect employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I purchased the home, the inspector stated no issues with the roof (minor wear and tear), but mostly that the gutters needed work. At the time, the paperwork stated the roof was 5 years old. This is not considered old for a roof (had no knowledge of said invoice at the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, we were able to hire a contractor for the gutters. The contractor admitted the gutters were bad, then stated our roof had a non-working ventilator (specifically listed in the invoice I saw to create/fix), and had new shingles placed on top of old shingles, thus voiding the warranty of the new shingles and making the roof &amp;quot;out of code&amp;quot;. Since I (confidentially) saw a contract for the roofing job and the price, I thought this person was trying to pull something on us. He was pushy about having our insurance cover replacing roof and gutters (there was mild hail damage) and we pay the deductible. We explained our roof was only ~5 years old, to which he was confident it was older. Knowing our roof was not the plan, with a contractor this pushy, we sought other contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few other calls, it felt like every contractor asked about our roof with no regard to our actual needs. I found a friendly contractor and asked: if these claims were made against your roof, and your mortgage contract said otherwise, what would you do? The sale of the new roof was under the previous owner&amp;#39;s name, so I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;d be able to contact the roofer. His advice was to contact the real estate agent. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second person who inspected our roof for gutter repair mentioned, unprompted, the same concerns about our roof: it&amp;#39;s out of code, there were shingles on shingles, this voids the warranty, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called my realtor, explained the situation, and told her that I confidentially knew that there was a sale on the roof of my house with very specific instructions that have been contradicted by two independent contractors quickly on inspecting my house. I explained I couldn&amp;#39;t disclose that info, but that if I could find the name of the roofing agency by honest means, we could pursue accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price charged (over double a typical roof of my slant/size) made me think the old owner was being scammed, and I was paying the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my realtor reviewed the files, it said our roof was 5 years old. The old owners lived there 3 years and (when recently asked) claimed there was no work done on the roof during their ownership, yet when they purchased the house, the documentation from prior owners stated it was 7 years old. Meaning when they sold the house, 7 + 3 =10. Why didn&amp;#39;t they claim a 10 year old roof? Why did they say it was 5 years old?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked my realtor if maybe I had bad info, that the owner had rental properties, and the invoice I saw was for a rental property but billed to that address. She checked, he didn&amp;#39;t. My realtor suggested that it was possibly insurance fraud, since the cost was so high, the work contradicted the invoice, and the roof magically got younger during their time living at that address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the company&amp;#39;s Google reviews, and saw a review from the same name as the previous owner of my house, at the company I know did the roofs, about the time and date that my roof was redone (The review is currently listed as 3 years old) talking about how great the roofers were, and how they double checked everything *before the insurance agent arrived*. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This owner is claiming no roof repairs were done to this house during his ownership which would be from 2015 to 2018, however his review indicates he hired a roofing company in 2016-2017 to do some work on the roof due to insurance issues, was 5 stars satisfied with the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we proceed? Based on the fact that the previous owner left a review of a roofing company mentioning work was done on his roof, but has told us that no work was performed on the roof while he owned the property, I feel that we have been misled about the state of the property when we purchased it. Should we contact a lawyer to proceed, contact our insurance company, or contact the roofing company? Based on the owners reply so far I don&amp;#39;t feel he will be giving honest information so I need some help moving forward so that I can resolve this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, legally, can I just go over to his house and collect my things? I still have my key so I can get in just fine. My main issue is that he had previously threatened to call the cops on me when I was trying to leave originally cause I was taking my computer, which had been a gift from him. So could he do that? And could he stop me from getting the rest of my things?&lt;/p&gt;

Hi All,

Located in San Diego, CA.

I have a bit of a complicated scenario I’m looking for legal advice. I worked for a tech company for 7 years. I was the Marketing Manager for at least 3 years. My company hired a Marketing Director (my boss) two years ago. They then hired a content writer less than a year ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit I received an email from my COO, who also cc’d my Marketing Director, that my position had been furloughed. My Marketing Director called me within 30 minutes letting me know she had no idea I was being furloughed. She said she would write a letter of recommendation for me and that I should probably start looking for a new role at a new company. 

Fast forward five weeks later. I’ve emailed my boss (Marketing Director) three times now to follow up on her reference letter offer. She has not responded. I heard from a colleague she put in her resignation notice and today was her last day. I went on LinkedIn and saw our content writer changed her title (was promoted) to Marketing Communications Manager. 

I still have no update from my boss, COO, or CEO on the status of my employment. The now Marketing Manager has been given all my responsibilities (I know this as I keep in touch with current employees). 

My question(s):

1. What do you recommend I do in my position as far as company communication?

2. Is there any legality giving someone else within the company my role while they furloughed me?

3. Do I have a case or any legal action against the fact that someone below me has been put in my role due to the current pandemic?",t2_6faf74pp,False,,0,False,Furloughed in America,[],r/legaladvice,False,6,,0,False,t3_gg8uzp,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1589027683.0,text,6,,,text,self.legaladvice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward five weeks later. I’ve emailed my boss (Marketing Director) three times now to follow up on her reference letter offer. She has not responded. I heard from a colleague she put in her resignation notice and today was her last day. I went on LinkedIn and saw our content writer changed her title (was promoted) to Marketing Communications Manager. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have no update from my boss, COO, or CEO on the status of my employment. The now Marketing Manager has been given all my responsibilities (I know this as I keep in touch with current employees). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question(s):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you recommend I do in my position as far as company communication?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there any legality giving someone else within the company my role while they furloughed me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I have a case or any legal action against the fact that someone below me has been put in my role due to the current pandemic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

,legaladvice,"Hey,

Here from the Immigration subreddit since I've been given more context from my mom and seen paperwork and read into everything I can on the internet and PDFs. I'm like 17 and haven't taken AP Gov yet, I just realized how confusing all of this can be. Lawyers out there, I appreciate you.

My mom, a US Citizen at the time, applied for her sister (from **India ,F4**) , and thereby her sister's family (of 1 spouse, two children), given the priority date of late Jul. 2008. At the time the elder sister was almost 11 years old. The federal case-online site said it was received on Feb 2010. My mom's lawyer said hopefully they'll be okay, but my mom doesn't contact her much, so my cousin and I called each other last night and figured we could look into it ourselves.

It took two years for the petition to reach and be approved by the USGov, and as of now it still hasn't been approved.

My cousin, the elder sister, has been **aged out according to the CSPA age calculator**, she's 21 years old and had the 2 year wait period subtracted to be 19, but her case is predicted to be in done in September 2024, so she'd have no chance I think.

Question's I have from this scenario are

1. Is the CSPA age calculator judging the predicted date based on the current work period they have? (I think they did about 2 weeks of visas for F4, between the April and May bulletin?)
2. Will **Coronavirus** extend the processing times/priority dates/whatever it's called? And if they do, will this help to prevent her age out?
3. Processing times will surely speed up post-pandemic, correct?
4. Once she ages out, is it better for her to apply for- **a student visa** (she's going to graduate from college with a Bachelors at 23, could do Masters in the US and attempt to gain permanent residency from Greencard lottery from there. I worry about her showing something called **Intent-To-Stay?** Read about it while looking at student visas, but they said visas can be revoked if you try and permanently immigrate.)- **her mother/father to apply for her while she stays in India alone** (probably doing her Masters there while she waits- **her brother to apply** (which I don't think would be a good idea since F4 is least prioritized?)- **an employment visa** with her Bachelors's, somehow gaining permanent residency from that point?
5. Just a general question, but why does CSPA subtract the approval-waiting time, which in our case was 2 years, and not the waiting period for the interview (post approval, 8 years for us?). No one probably knows a reason but I was just surprised to see only 2 years get subtracted since we and many others have probably waited many, many years.

I'm so sorry for so many questions, I'm just trying to figure something out and have been all day, before she wakes up and reads all the articles and screenshots of charts and dates I've sent her.

,legaladvice,"First time poster.

My grandma has three children. My mom and my two uncles. My grandparents lived across the country, but after my grandpa died, the uncles stopped seeing or helping my grandma. My mom eventually moved my grandma to our state and had her live in a very very expensive retirement community.

My grandma started to have worse and worse dementia and a few months ago my mom and Grandma had to move in together. I am visiting and my grandma needs constant care. She cannot turn the stove on by herself and refuses to shower. She refuses to have any help come in so my mom is her personal chef, nurse and everything. My mom has to be at the house most of the day and can't really have a full time job unless they paid someone else to nurse my grandma, but grandma refuses.

My mom has power of attorney and is using my grandma's money to pay the rent, buy groceries and gives herself some money from my Grandma's saving. She also has been buying extra things for the house and things for herself like clothes, but she has purchased a few extensive items like a new computer using my grandma's money.

My grandma knows about the rent and the food, but she always complains that she is paying all the rent (although we saved her over $1,200 by moving her from the living center to this much bigger and better house). On top of that, if my grandma has less then 130,000 in her bank account, she qualifies for some kind of veterans assistance so my mom has been slowly taking money out of her account so she can get help when the time comes to need more help. Otherwise, that money would go away pretty fast if she had to pay for constant nurses and care.

My uncle threatened to call the police when they were moving in together and they think my Mom is being abusive toward her and spending all her money and taking advantage of her. They refuse to believe my grandma has any problems and have no appreciation that my mom dropped everything to care for my grandma all day. Her will is split three ways between the two uncles and my mom.

I have talked to my mom about having a written agreement that grandma pays her a certain amount per/month to have it all in writing, but my grandma refuses to admit she needs help or there is anything wrong with her or that my mom even helps her with anything. When my uncles calls, she complains about how badly she is being treated and that she wants to leave. They never visit her or even call her and have no interests in ever taking care of her.

When she dies, can my uncles sue my mom for the money she is using  and how can she protect herself from that.

Edit-I live in the USA

Edit 2- Forgot to clarify that my grandma cannot take care of ANY of her finances and fight my mom on everything. She refuses to pay her taxes and has spent up to 30,000 on investment scam stuff. My mom has to pay her taxes and cancel these scams somewhat against her will. Even if we get written agreements, it is probable that she will forget and deny she signed them if someone asked.

&lt;p&gt;My mom has power of attorney and is using my grandma&amp;#39;s money to pay the rent, buy groceries and gives herself some money from my Grandma&amp;#39;s saving. She also has been buying extra things for the house and things for herself like clothes, but she has purchased a few extensive items like a new computer using my grandma&amp;#39;s money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandma knows about the rent and the food, but she always complains that she is paying all the rent (although we saved her over $1,200 by moving her from the living center to this much bigger and better house). On top of that, if my grandma has less then 130,000 in her bank account, she qualifies for some kind of veterans assistance so my mom has been slowly taking money out of her account so she can get help when the time comes to need more help. Otherwise, that money would go away pretty fast if she had to pay for constant nurses and care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My uncle threatened to call the police when they were moving in together and they think my Mom is being abusive toward her and spending all her money and taking advantage of her. They refuse to believe my grandma has any problems and have no appreciation that my mom dropped everything to care for my grandma all day. Her will is split three ways between the two uncles and my mom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have talked to my mom about having a written agreement that grandma pays her a certain amount per/month to have it all in writing, but my grandma refuses to admit she needs help or there is anything wrong with her or that my mom even helps her with anything. When my uncles calls, she complains about how badly she is being treated and that she wants to leave. They never visit her or even call her and have no interests in ever taking care of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she dies, can my uncles sue my mom for the money she is using  and how can she protect herself from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit-I live in the USA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2- Forgot to clarify that my grandma cannot take care of ANY of her finances and fight my mom on everything. She refuses to pay her taxes and has spent up to 30,000 on investment scam stuff. My mom has to pay her taxes and cancel these scams somewhat against her will. Even if we get written agreements, it is probable that she will forget and deny she signed them if someone asked.  &lt;/p&gt;

So I thought this should have been pretty easy to do myself. I receive food share and use CBD products occasionally. I had to go in and take a drug screen. it came back 29ng/20ng cutoff. They denied me for 12 months for positive test.

"" The petitioner could be correct. Some CBD products have small amounts of THC that could result in a positive drug test. Some CBD products have no THC.

Hi LegalAdvice community,

Looking to include some quotes from authors and business leaders in my product (journal).

I've already done a bit of research, but the info I found are mostly around quoting movies/songs/anime on T-shirts &amp; mugs, hence I'd like to ask more specifically. (I'm based in Australia.)

I do plan to attribute the authors either way, but because I'm going to include at least 90-100 quotes (3,4 quotes from different authors), it could take me forever to go through the process asking for permission. I just want to ship an MVP by the end of this month, and start getting some income during this period. (No job at the moment.)

**Will I be at the risk of infringement if:**

* Half of the quotes in the journal are going to be my original thoughts, but the other half are from these authors and business leaders (as their quotes have had a positive impact on my life so I want to include them in my product).
* Each quote will be fewer than 15 words, mostly found from their email newsletters or noted down when from their podcasts. Some quotes will be from their books but are still fewer than 15 words. Does this mean the quote is too short to be protected by copyright and is open for public use?
* The quotes aren't in public domain. They're from people such as Seth Godin and Ryan Holiday who are still well and alive, or lesser-known leaders from the advertising industry who could be harder to contact.
* I'd also like to include some URLs to interesting YouTube videos (e.g. TED Talks, or insightful interviews). I've read it's okay but want to be sure.
* Yes, the journal is to sell as an eCommerce product, for profit.

**What I know so far:**

* ""Generally speaking, short phrases and titles cannot be copyrighted, especially if there is only a limited number of ways you could express the same idea/concept.""
* It's okay to quote a book title (not its content), a fact, or a very short phrase (but there's no specific details on the length).
* This is a copyright-related question, not trademark-related.
* I'm not quoting a song lyric, nor poem, which means less likely to have copyright issues. (Doesn't mean it's okay to use it though if it's not the right thing to do...)
* I'm not using more than a few sentences length from a book, so my quotes shouldn't impact the value of the original work. But for email newsletters and podcasts, I'm not sure?
* If anything, my journal is raising awareness towards the authors I admire, rather than plagiarising their work as I'm going to attribute them...?

Thanks!

,legaladvice,"Hello and good day, this is a throw away account since I am a very private person and have anxiety related to privacy due to being agoraphobic


For context, I have recorded the phone conversation between myself and the Subway store owner (although I cannot post it here at /r/legaladvice).  I recorded the conversation because I realized after 7 minutes of talking to him about not receiving food for pick up he was becoming more hostile, accusatory, and yelling at me.

When I posted this originally my own youtube channel and not a throw away youtube channel, I shared this with Subway corporate as well as him.


He then [posted this as a comment which he later then deleted](https://i.imgur.com/tpqRmWV.png) but I still have it in my youtube notifications of what he posted regardless of him deleting it, because that message was redirected to me from the youtube servers where the message is still saved



He has accused me of:

1)  A liar

2)  A thief

3)  Organized Crime

4)  Technologically unaware

Also the most offensive thing he suggested was that my mom should go to the Subway store and order in person (even though she has a cochlear implant and can't hear that well doesn't understand English) for a longer duration than necessary during COVID-19 in new york city, the largest city effected in the USA.


I do not take this lightly at all, my father passed away in January, 5 months ago it will be in 10 days from today. And I do not appreciate having to think about any scenario of which the few of the family I have left will pass away because a SUBWAY STORE OWNER DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO EFFECTIVELY RUN A SUBWAY IN 2020 WHEN ONLINE ORDERING IS A COMMON THING.

All of which I find offensive, over $17.69.  Why did they give my mom a receipt for the food but no food?  If other people took my order like they suggested, then why didn't they give them the receipt?  [Why is there a receipt left to give to my mom?](https://i.imgur.com/d0k7eTD.jpg)


My phone number is on the receipt, why they call it to make sure whoever was picking up my order was me by simply calling?

There is a unique order confirmation #


Why did they not double check with the persons picking up the order this UNIQUE confirmation #?  Is this not the purpose of the UNIQUE order confirmation number?

Only the legitimate customer can know it, instead the employees just assumed the first person to walk through the door was there to pick up my order instead and asked if they were me.



This is the only way I can think of what happened, happened if what the Subway store owner was saying is true or rather his employees are saying is true because the store owner had told me over the phone he was not present at the subway store.  Instead when I called him, he simply called the Subway store and asked the employees what happened and believed it without questioning at all and then defaulting to accuse me.

I saw a promotion from Subway for pick up orders due to COVID-19 and to practice safe social distancing to lessen time spent in the physical store.


The promotion was exclusive to online / pick up orders placed online at the subway.com website:

I don't order subway often, 4 times total since the beginning of this year and since I have been agoraphobic -2004.

I used to enjoy Subway a lot more as a teenager, there was one near my dad's office 17 or so years ago and I would spend a lot of time at my dad's office around then and we would have a tradition getting subway for lunch together if we were lazy since it was close by.


But either my taste for Subway since I was a teenager has changed or the sandwiches have.

My dad passed away back in the middle of January of this year, 4 months ago and some days. [A few months later in March I would order Subway 3 different times](https://i.imgur.com/CZKWGLD.png), all the same kind of order, [at least 1 meatball and 1 chicken teriyaki since we shared half a footlong of those and 1 other variety of sandwich](https://i.imgur.com/1tP6Teg.png) to see what's new at subway for pick up online I guess to help me relive a moment with my dad from years ago.


It's just not as good as I remember, but I figured since all the restaurants that I frequent near me are mostly closed or I am bored of what is left available I thought I'd get subway since it is cheap considering my order was only $17.69 which is a lot cheaper than [what I normally spend on delivery/take out meals (usually anywhere from $30-$100)](https://imgur.com/a/cOKRvrr) and thought it might bring back some momentary nostalgia.


[This order history is from delivery.com where I have never had a problem over years and this is only half my orders since I also order from Seamless / Grubhub for more variety of food since there restaurants on Seamless / Grubhub that are no available on delivery.com](https://imgur.com/a/cOKRvrr)


If you notice throughout my history I used to buy cigarettes delivered to my door through their delivery service, the mark up was incredibly high, [$18.95 a pack and would order about 7 packs a time also having to pay a 15% delivery tip and then tax](https://i.imgur.com/ezxYfyq.png) 


But that was the price I was paying since I am an agoraphobic and having anxiety with my privacy and leaving my apartment



The most infuriating thing about all of this is that his Subway store is being leased by the apartment building I live in.  And my family is the home owner of our apartment, BUT I AM PAYING THE MORTGAGE AND MAINTENANCE FEES.


So I am essentially chipping money for the maintenance fees to help maintain his Subway store.


I feel very bad and humiliated


The whole reason why I do not go outside is because I used to face a lot of judgement and I felt ashamed.


I remember one of the few days I was leaving my apartment building and the ""doorman"" / concierge did not know who I was nor did I know her.  I was getting off the elevator and entering the lobby where my own concierge looked at me and said, ""wow you're the fattest chink I ever saw""  I was leaving the apartment building at the time to collect a treadmill I was collecting from the delivery truck parked outside.  I remember feeling very unsafe even just leaving outside my apartment door after that.


The only few times I have ever left my apartment since 2004 was to go to a dentist, two times and attending my father's funeral and burial service.  I am sure there are other few moments, but there are spans of 1-4 years I never leave at all.


I don't know anyone locally, I don't have any friends locally, how am I supposed to arrange people to come steal food from a Subway store?


The store owner is accusing me of being a liar, a thief, organizing some sort of crime between myself and others, when in reality I do not harm anyone simply based on the fact I don't even have access to anyone.


It really hurts me because now I feel even less safer at home, if I cannot feel safe at home then where can I feel safe?


I am being shamed, labeled a criminal, liar, thief, scammer and I did nothing without any possibility to do anything he is saying.


I have spent the past 16 years avoiding any reason why anyone should judge me


That day I was offering to give him my business which if continued he could make a lot of repeat business off me since pretty much one of the few luxuries I get experience in life as an agoraphobic is ordering food, and I order a lot.

But instead that day I was left negative money and no food
How is ANY of that fair?


I feel ashamed for having to defend myself by exposing myself with my secret I keep from anyone I do know who is not my family (online friends, well online friend) when all I did was order sandwiches that were promoted to use the Online order pick up service.


I even called corporate and have a phone conversation with them,  they have not helped me at all since.  Thinking about this keeps me up at night and even prevents me from fulfilling my work and I am very busy the next two months.

&lt;p&gt;For context, I have recorded the phone conversation between myself and the Subway store owner (although I cannot post it here at &lt;a href=""/r/legaladvice""&gt;/r/legaladvice&lt;/a&gt;).  I recorded the conversation because I realized after 7 minutes of talking to him about not receiving food for pick up he was becoming more hostile, accusatory, and yelling at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I posted this originally my own youtube channel and not a throw away youtube channel, I shared this with Subway corporate as well as him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/tpqRmWV.png""&gt;posted this as a comment which he later then deleted&lt;/a&gt; but I still have it in my youtube notifications of what he posted regardless of him deleting it, because that message was redirected to me from the youtube servers where the message is still saved&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has accused me of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)  A liar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  A thief&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)  Organized Crime&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4)  Technologically unaware&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the most offensive thing he suggested was that my mom should go to the Subway store and order in person (even though she has a cochlear implant and can&amp;#39;t hear that well doesn&amp;#39;t understand English) for a longer duration than necessary during COVID-19 in new york city, the largest city effected in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

ex raped, abused, manipulated me, damaged my property, stalked me, threatened to steal our daughter, gave away my dog, and is abusive to his little sister too, is irresponsible and reckless with our daughter when given the chance. Recently groped me after we broke up. I never reported him because I was dumb and cared too much. We have a 6 month old daughter together, and he's not on the birth certificate, my daughter has my last name, paternity hasn't been established but I know for a fact he's the dad. He helps with nothing other than 2 outfits, 3 boxes of diapers, and a cheap toy or two. Is it worth pursuing child support? Is there a way to keep him from my daughter or keep him from getting any sort of custodial rights? Is there a legal way I can keep him from visiting whatsoever? He's been visiting once or twice a month, for an hour or so. He has to be supervised by my family or he tries to be manipulative, make me cry, or get in my pants. He also is reckless with holding our daughter wrong 

&lt;This parts mainly for venting and more details&gt; long version: Soooo my dumb ass made the mistake of dating an abusive and very manipulative douche. This guy has beaten my dog (extra cruel bc he knew he was a rescue, my dog had been a bait dog prior to us having him) and gave him away to someone hours away, who then took him a few states over and abandoned him at a pound. My car was broken down at the time and I couldn't rescue my dog, and it still haunts me to not know what happened to him. He has been known to throw his little sister off him while yelling expletives like ""fuck off!"" While playing video games, he cracked my windshield punching it, would pick me up drunk from bars after we broke up to take advantage of me and then verbally abuse me and ditch me on the side of the road, miles from my car in winter at 2am without my phone or jacket, then come back acting nice to lure me back in after leaving me for 20 minutes or so, just to continue verbally abusing me. He would drive past my house multiple times a night every night most of one year and still occasionally did from time to time after he stopped doing it regularly. He also broke into my friend's house while we were broken up to ""make sure I wasn't having sex"" and followed me out to make sure I left, then followed my car no matter where I drove or how I tried to lose him. He lied to coworkers, friends, family, etc that I was cheating and abusive, so that they'd pity him and take his side when I broke up with him. everything was always my fault, he never could accept responsibility. He also used up all my money back in 2016. He used me to cheat on his new girlfriends. He got me pregnant and wanted to make things work and my dumb ass believed when he said he'd get better. He then cheated on me while I was pregnant, made threats to kidnap my kid, and then when he found out I wasn't going to put him on the birth certificate or give his last name, he broke up with me and left me for the other girl, a few days after birth. He didn't show up to the hospital until i was close to giving birth, and he came cross faded as hell, smelling like he had a sex marathon with the new girl. He even tried to bring her in to watch me give birth.

ex raped, abused, manipulated me, damaged my property, stalked me, threatened to steal our daughter, gave away my dog, and is abusive to his little sister too, is irresponsible and reckless with our daughter when given the chance. Recently groped me after we broke up. I never reported him because I was dumb and cared too much. We have a 6 month old daughter together, and he&amp;#39;s not on the birth certificate, my daughter has my last name, paternity hasn&amp;#39;t been established but I know for a fact he&amp;#39;s the dad. He helps with nothing other than 2 outfits, 3 boxes of diapers, and a cheap toy or two. Is it worth pursuing child support? Is there a way to keep him from my daughter or keep him from getting any sort of custodial rights? Is there a legal way I can keep him from visiting whatsoever? He&amp;#39;s been visiting once or twice a month, for an hour or so. He has to be supervised by my family or he tries to be manipulative, make me cry, or get in my pants. He also is reckless with holding our daughter wrong &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;This parts mainly for venting and more details&amp;gt; long version: Soooo my dumb ass made the mistake of dating an abusive and very manipulative douche. This guy has beaten my dog (extra cruel bc he knew he was a rescue, my dog had been a bait dog prior to us having him) and gave him away to someone hours away, who then took him a few states over and abandoned him at a pound. My car was broken down at the time and I couldn&amp;#39;t rescue my dog, and it still haunts me to not know what happened to him. He has been known to throw his little sister off him while yelling expletives like &amp;quot;fuck off!&amp;quot; While playing video games, he cracked my windshield punching it, would pick me up drunk from bars after we broke up to take advantage of me and then verbally abuse me and ditch me on the side of the road, miles from my car in winter at 2am without my phone or jacket, then come back acting nice to lure me back in after leaving me for 20 minutes or so, just to continue verbally abusing me. He would drive past my house multiple times a night every night most of one year and still occasionally did from time to time after he stopped doing it regularly. He also broke into my friend&amp;#39;s house while we were broken up to &amp;quot;make sure I wasn&amp;#39;t having sex&amp;quot; and followed me out to make sure I left, then followed my car no matter where I drove or how I tried to lose him. He lied to coworkers, friends, family, etc that I was cheating and abusive, so that they&amp;#39;d pity him and take his side when I broke up with him. everything was always my fault, he never could accept responsibility. He also used up all my money back in 2016. He used me to cheat on his new girlfriends. He got me pregnant and wanted to make things work and my dumb ass believed when he said he&amp;#39;d get better. He then cheated on me while I was pregnant, made threats to kidnap my kid, and then when he found out I wasn&amp;#39;t going to put him on the birth certificate or give his last name, he broke up with me and left me for the other girl, a few days after birth. He didn&amp;#39;t show up to the hospital until i was close to giving birth, and he came cross faded as hell, smelling like he had a sex marathon with the new girl. He even tried to bring her in to watch me give birth. This isn&amp;#39;t everything he did, but point is he&amp;#39;s a terrible abusive person, and I know he&amp;#39;d treat my daughter poorly if given the chance to be alone with her. He already let her head flop and dangle as a newborn, no matter how many times he was corrected by nurses even, he would torture my baby by waking her up the moment she fell asleep, over and over again, until she was screaming crying, just so he could take selfies with her, etc. I&amp;#39;ve seen how neglectful him and his parents were with his baby sister, so him dumping my baby on them, or them supervising is not much of an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"Hello! 

I have a good friend who was pulled over for expired tags in 2017. The officer gave him a citation, my friend renewed his registration and took the receipt to the county clerk and they waived the ticket.

Today he was driving with his girlfriend in her car, and an officer started following them. After a few minutes he turned on his lights and they pulled over. The officer said he had looked up her plates, and even though her tags were current, that they had been canceled and she would need to go to the clerk and fix it. He then took my friends license and registration as well. 

When the officer came back, he had a criminal summons stating my friend had been given a citation in 2017 for expired tags and never followed up. My friend remembered when it had happened and knows he then renewed his registration and took the receipt to the clerk to have them waive the ticket.

He has a court date now. How does he prove that he updated his registration three years ago and corrected the problem? He doesn’t have the registration receipt, because he’s updated it every year since then. 

Would it not be in their system that he corrected the issue? Does he need a lawyer for this court date? How does he go about proving he paid his dues three years ago?

,legaladvice,"North Carolina. My(27F) dad died in March 2019, leaving behind a 1987 run-down Mercedes (probably worth less than 1k) and 16k of hospital bills racked up within the last 3 months of his life. He had no other property or assets, and no will.

We left his estate alone, along with all of the bills that are in his name.

Friend informs Nurse that Baby has been tested positive for Covid-19 and that Friend was instructed by Boss not to tell Nurse.

Months later, Nurse has not been informed.

According to Friend:

1) Friend could get in serious trouble for telling Nurse what she told her

2) Boss stated that the reason for not telling Nurse is that she is 'at low risk' even though she is required to hold, weigh, and administer shot to Baby, who cries, and snots. Also, a member of Nurse's household has heart conditions and recently had 5-bypass open heart surgery.

I want to preemptively apologizing for my actions in the following story. I made several really shitty life choices after my fiancé died and I was a mess. I know this is a long shot but here it goes.  

I read: “Contract law also holds that a contract made by an intoxicated person is voidable, as the person was incompetent at the time the contract was formed.”
So I’m trying to understand my situation would 
be considered under this. 

Long story:

It’s been almost a year since I signed papers to sell my home in Oregon. I was in foreclosure and approaching the cutoff date and desperately trying to fix up my house to sell it. 
I had a realtor put it on the market. The house was put on the market for about $330,000. I only owed $90,000. 
Again I was desperate because the impending foreclosure. I was drinking heavily and in a very very bad mental state. 

Preemptive apologies for my following actions:
I found a room to rent on Craigslist while planning to sell. I get raped there while drunk. 
I leave the house and get a dui. 

I go to the sobering center for the night, get picked up by the realtor’s worker and he takes me to sign the papers. She tells me then she could only get $120,000. And by now we wouldn’t have time to stall foreclosure (I had done this previously with the owner- it was a private mortgage). 

So I was in withdrawals from being at the sobering center and detoxing, so I immediately had to get alcohol into my system so I could even sign the papers. 

I don’t remember anything about it really. I agreed to half of what she originally put it on the market for. She said I’d loose it otherwise and it was the best she could do. 

I stayed drunk for a few days while waiting to get into a rehab. Yes, I was that physically dependent I was in danger of DT’s if I didn’t drink. 

So now, clean and sober for many months- and this story came up and I was told that because I shouldn’t have signed because of my mental state- essentially mentally unfit at the time. 
I can show in documents the date of arrest and signing were within 18 hours. 

Again, I know it’s a long shot, but sober me hates everything that happened and I’m just praying there is anything I can do. I lost my moms retirement money and my life savings over this situation. 

So please if there’s even the slightest possibility I can do anything I will.

,legaladvice,"Hi Everyone, thanks in advance for any advice that can be provided. Looking for some guidance and see what types of recourse I have available.

I am in Alameda county, California, USA.

My friend and I signed a new lease at a condo a few days ago.

A few days later, our building caught fire (neighboring unit at fault), then the hallway flooded, leading to a large chunk of our floor of the building flooding. I should add that we are on the 3rd floor of a 3 story building. The water ended up flooding our dwelling, we have laminate/hardwood and carpeting, which were ruined.

None of us were harmed and none of our possessions were permanently damaged fortunately, but the dwelling is uninhabitable currently due to the water/fire damage and soot. Due to Covid, I was already working remote from a relative's house so I wasn't present when this incident occurred. My roommate is staying with some friends for the moment after the incident happened

We got some basics out of the way with our landlord, as we are not at fault in any way, and since this happened at the beginning of the month, they offered not to charge rent, and it will not affect our deposit. However, the place is uninhabitable, it reeks of smoke/soot smell, and the carpet is ruined. The cleaning up crew that came by also reported that while we can come/go as needed, we cannot stay there either until it is livable again, my understanding is that they will fix up the main section, uncertain for our dwelling though.

We were also informed that they are waiting on the insurance/adjuster folks to make their report on the incident as far as damages and reimbursement is concerned for the building.

Our landlord was saying that if the place can't be fixed quickly, there was talk of breaking our lease so we can move elsewhere. The problem is, we would prefer NOT to move if possible as the location is otherwise solid for us, and we have a good relationship with the landlord.

We do not have any sort of renters insurance on our end either. I believe the landlord/building management both have the respective types of insurance for the building and individual condo however.

Apologies if I missed any details that might be important.

My questions are:

* Can our landlord just break our lease like that? 
* Do we have any recourse requiring them to find temporary housing in the meantime or anything of that nature?
* What sort of tenant rights are available to us, or rather, where can we look further into these?

,legaladvice,"This is a follow up regarding [my post](https://redd.it/gaq19p) from 8 days ago.

Summary from previous post: Roommate tried to break the lease under Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-402, claiming a stalker is trying to break into her window on the 4th floor at night to rape her.

In an email exchange with my roommate and the apartment manager, I told her I'm happy to work with her so this process is fair for everyone. I offered to start looking for a new roommate after finals (next week) and I'll sign her off the lease as soon as she pays for the damages to the master and May's rent.

-----

She ignored my offer and insisted she could break the lease and be absolved from this apartment with nothing more than a police report number. The leasing office manager didn't buy her story, and requested an official police report and RO. She stopped responding to emails after that.

On May 5th, she showed up with her new boyfriend (the 4th one she's been able to manipulate since living with me) and a moving truck. She packed up and told a huge lie about how a local charity is going to pay her rent and damages to the bedroom.

I haven't heard from her since she moved out (unsurprising). I sent her one final text this morning reminding her that she is still on the lease here, and she is legally just as responsible for this apartment as I am. No reply.

I'd like to start looking for a new roommate (probably not on reddit), but no one is going to move into a bedroom in this condition. The room stinks. Her cat scratched up and peed on the carpet for months. The walls are covered in grease patches where her bed was. She spilled eyebrow wax and make up all over the master bathroom counter, sink, and white cabinets. She's damaged the walls with stickers that won't come off. She ripped the screen off one of her windows and has been throwing garbage out the window onto the roof...

The maintenance manager estimated damages will cost over $1500. This apartment is newly renovated with brand new carpet installed before I moved in. He said the entire bedroom would need to be re-painted. They are going to try to get the bathroom professionally cleaned, but he is concerned about the make up stains and wax.

I applied for help through my Uni's emergency fund program when my roommate started lying about the rapist. I was approved for an $800 micro-grant, which will cover most of her rent for May. I still need to (somehow) pay for repairs to the master, have the work done, and find another roommate before June 1st.

I will continue to work as a TA while taking classes this summer, but I don't have an extra $1500 lying around. I have enough money budgeted to cover my half of rent and utilities until I get my next grant and scholarship disbursement for the fall, but that money is earmarked for rent and bills during the fall semester (I graduate spring, 2021).

I don't know what to do next. I've lived at this apartment complex for almost 5 years with perfect payment history. The leasing office manager isn't charging late fees and she's willing to work with me on this issue, but they understandably can't repair the room for free.

Sorry this post became so long... This situation is insane and I can't begin to describe the amount of stress this has caused during finals.

After playing for a while I found that the game wasn't enjoyable because of how weak my characters were.  So I decided to purchase ""Downloadable Content"" or whatever you want to call it so that I could strengthen my characters faster and be able to enjoy playing the game.

Now that I'm able to get the full experience of playing the game, I'm beginning to notice that it has multiple issues (lagging, disconnecting, freezing, etc.).  I've noticed these problems long before the stay at home orders, so it's not just because of increased traffic.  The thing is I never played the game often enough to realize how often these issues occurred.  I always thought it was just my internet connection or that the game needed an update, but it's been constantly doing this for the past 3-4 months.  I switched phone carriers and I'm still having the same issues. Sometimes the game will tell me I have a weak connection when I have perfect reception.  Sometimes I can't play the game at all, recently it's started to tell me the game is unavailable and to try again later.  Some of these things have grown into a known issues apparently.  

At this point I'm tempted to just stop playing because i get more frustrated than entertained by it.  At the same time though I've put money into the game and I'd feel cheated if I stopped playing.

I might be able to screenshot their response if you want to see it.

Do I have any options here other than accepting being cheated and moving on?  I just want my money back or at least to be fairly compensated.

I&amp;#39;ve messaged the game developer multiple times and requested a refund on my money and their response is an apology for my inconvenience and a free item to use in the game and then they&amp;#39;ll ask me if they answered all my questions... I might be able to screenshot their response if you want to see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I have any options here other than accepting being cheated and moving on?  I just want my money back or at least to be fairly compensated.  The free item they give me is disrespectful compared to the amount of money I&amp;#39;ve put into the game.  That free item isn&amp;#39;t even equal to 1% of what I&amp;#39;ve spent on this game.  I&amp;#39;m not sure if it matters but I live in California.&lt;/p&gt;

All of them were ALS and so my poor paramedic had to tech every one. On the day in question, we had low ambulance levels the whole day, and never stopped running  and therefore didn't have a chance to complete any one of our Patient Care Reports before the day was done.  (PCR's). Now we have a policy that states that all PCR's must be completed within an hour of the call if at all possible, but they must be completed before you leave to go home with no exceptions. This means my partner had to stay after his shift was supposed to end and fill out all the PCR's that he didn't have the time to during the day. Because of the chaos of the day, it was exceedingly difficult to match the correct patient information to each call since hours had passed since we had run them. He ended up staying there for the next 6 hours filling out these PCR's to completion in order to comply with policy.

He remained clocked in during this time and racked up a whopping 6 hours of overtime in one night.

But then he was later brought in to a meeting with the higher ups who questioned him about the overtime. He told them the story, but when they heard it, they just told him that they believed he could have gotten it done faster and shouldn't have had to work so much overtime.

After months of stalling Boston Calling announced they would cancel the festival and opened up only a 6 day long window to collect refunds.

My  email:

Hello,

I'm writing to you very frustrated. I've  had a terrible series of weeks. I lost my job, my cousin (a police  officer) contracted COVID and has been in and out of the hospital in  critical condition. I had no idea that there was a one week window to  receive refunds. My cousin has only recently been deemed relatively  stable, and I finally found out about the refund situation.

This isn't right. I just called frontgate and they told me I needed to  contact you. How is it fair that we hear nothing for months until March  31, then released the refund instructions weeks later but only kept the  window open for one week? I have had many other things to worry about, and  tickets to the next Boston Calling aren't going to help any of my  problems now.  Please, do the right thing here, I'm begging you. This $539 is nothing  to a company like yours but means so much to me right now.   

Please, OP

* What can she do to me legally? (they apparently have a lot of money... or so they say)

* What recourse do I have to make her stop harassing me?

just in case you are wondering what the problem noise is, its a fan that runs during the day and I turn off at night to align with quiet hours. To combat their noise complaints I have been keeping a log of every noise I notice in the building with dates and times, just in case. But of course have noted date and times of my interactions with this individual. 

to note as well I have contacted the HOA I live with and they have said they will side with me on this situation. I am more worried about them threatening me.

I could 100% pull off my brother or forward it to myself(as he pretended to be me who knows how many times, I&amp;#39;ve had warrants, hospital bills, debt collectors etc etc from where he&amp;#39;s assumed my identity) but both would be breaking the law if they ever did their homework so really don&amp;#39;t wanna go that route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in US..Alabama of course..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should include there is no Estate Account nor did he have any bank accounts..or anything.   We&amp;#39;ve got death certificate, birth cert, ss card etc&lt;/p&gt;

However, we currently have a 13 month lease for our apartment that isn't up until next year. While we cannot be evicted, our landlord still wants us to pay rent continually. We aren't really happy with our living arrangements currently so if we could get out we'd be happier. We have a few months left but are wondering if there's anything in place due to the virus that would help us not be negatively affected for when we recover and continue renting.

I should mention that we haven't spoken to our landlord yet to see if they would be willing to allow us to break the lease, and this is an option we will try, but I figured I'd ask here in the meantime. I'm not sure if they'd do this however, as this is a pretty large rental company and not private so I feel my chances are slim.

My ex and I have been separated for almost 6 years now and have never had a formal custody agreement. For a long time, we were able to be amicable. Basically throughout the last couple years, he would get upset about something and stop communicating with me and other childish things. I let it go because, honestly, it wasn’t ever anything that really effected me. I was irritated but that never seemed like a reason to waste the time and money on court and a lawyer to do custody. Plus I know it would be a fight and mentally taxing because he won’t agree with me on anything. 

Over the summer, he got mad at me about my decisions and stopped paying child support. That was almost a year ago. Luckily, I am able to support myself and my child without him, but that’s not the point of child support. I still didn’t take him to court. He then stopped communicating with me again so I made the decision to buy my daughter a phone, even though I didn’t want to (she’s 9) because I needed to be able to know if she’s ok. Through this, I started learning that when he has her (every weekend Friday through Sunday and some thursdays) he barely has her. He will take her to his grandparents house and then to his cousins house and sometimes he will see her for a few minutes on Saturday and then he will pick her up and drop her off to me Sunday at noon. 

This obviously upset me so I began documenting everything because I started planning on taking him to court. What has pushed me over the edge currently is that his job had a case of covid and he was exposed. I have a newborn and he didn’t tell me until he dropped our daughter off. Knowing that he exposed her. I then had to have her quarantined with my mom, which was still a risk because my mom doesn’t have the best immune system but it was safer than her being there with a newborn. So that was last week, she isn’t done being quarantined until Sunday. He wanted to pick her up on Thursday as normal. Him and I spoke about him not getting her for a month just in case which he claims he doesn’t remember saying. 

I have made the difficult decision to keep her from him. I don’t want to do this. But he is still going to work, he works in a small space with a lot of people. He doesn’t know who else was exposed. I don’t know what else to do for my daughters safety and the safety of my newborn. Legally, I know there is nothing he can do, we don’t have an agreement. But when we go to court, will this be used against me? Will a judge think I did a the wrong thing or the right thing? I feel like this is the right thing to do. If this virus wasn’t happening, I would have never even thought of keeping my daughter.

He will take her to his grandparents house and then to his cousins house and sometimes he will see her for a few minutes on Saturday and then he will pick her up and drop her off to me Sunday at noon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This obviously upset me so I began documenting everything because I started planning on taking him to court. What has pushed me over the edge currently is that his job had a case of covid and he was exposed. I have a newborn and he didn’t tell me until he dropped our daughter off. Knowing that he exposed her. I then had to have her quarantined with my mom, which was still a risk because my mom doesn’t have the best immune system but it was safer than her being there with a newborn. So that was last week, she isn’t done being quarantined until Sunday. He wanted to pick her up on Thursday as normal. Him and I spoke about him not getting her for a month just in case which he claims he doesn’t remember saying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made the difficult decision to keep her from him. I don’t want to do this. But he is still going to work, he works in a small space with a lot of people. He doesn’t know who else was exposed. I don’t know what else to do for my daughters safety and the safety of my newborn. Legally, I know there is nothing he can do, we don’t have an agreement. But when we go to court, will this be used against me? Will a judge think I did a the wrong thing or the right thing? I feel like this is the right thing to do. If this virus wasn’t happening, I would have never even thought of keeping my daughter.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"Let me start by saying that my adoptive father and I have never gotten along particularly well. My younger years were pretty hell, and I can elaborate details later. He has pretty severe control issues,

My father has made it clear that he would like to have not only my, but my brothers adoptions nullified. This is because he treated us like shit when we were young and living under his roof. However, now that we are old enough and don't live under his roof (therefore he cant control us), he's ready to be finished with us.

To make things easier to understand, he's the kind of person one posts about on r/insaneparents. Some talking points:

\-Stalked me throughout college 500 miles from home. (He would literally randomly show up around campus, driving rental cars. Security forced him to leave.)

\-Finding ways into accounts used not only for school, but personal use, and impersonating me to people who I know and friends. (This included changing passwords and accessing emails for the college I was working for at the time.)

\-Disrespects everyone that I choose to have relationships with-just because he can.

\-Threatens frivolous lawsuits because he knows that I cannot afford to handle a lawsuit (Who can?)

\-Decided that he is out to ruin my ""perfect little life"".

I tried to deal with and work with him to maintain a better father-son relationship after I moved out, thinking that this was ""normal"" and ""what everyone deals with"". I did this because I did not have an idea on what a normal parent-child relationship looks like.

THE MEAT AND TATERS'

After removing him and his negativity from my life, he now wants me to pick up my ""important documents"". Now, to those other Redditors who are adopted, they will have a very strong understanding of what these are-and how much they mean to someone who is adopted. These are the kinds of things like baby pictures, documents telling the story of your biological parents and things that tell the story truthfully.

After arguing back and forth about when and where I was going to get them from him, he decided that  he doesn't have to give them back, and he would rather just burn them than give them to me.I have always preferred to do things being the 'nice guy' but obviously this is not gonna happen.

&lt;p&gt;But, she didn&amp;#39;t let up. I knew something wasn&amp;#39;t right. I ran to the door, and a delivery driver was holding the storm door shut with her foot. Dog was jumping on the door hard. I apologized profusely, but she wasn&amp;#39;t having it. Understandably, she was pissed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package wasn&amp;#39;t mine, or my mother&amp;#39;s,  so I had no notice of it coming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is this, could she sue for mental damages? File a police report for my dog trying to attack her? I&amp;#39;m sure she was terrified, and she was for sure mad. I feel like an absolute schmuck for reaching out to make sure she can&amp;#39;t do anything about it. But, it&amp;#39;s not my house, and I don&amp;#39;t want my mother to get in any kind of trouble for my stupidity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t get bit, so I don&amp;#39;t think anything can be done, just want to cover all my bases. Thank you guys so much for any help you can offer.&lt;/p&gt;

I just moved to a new apartment owned by a leasing company and unfortunately a decent amount of repairs needed to be done (we were restricted from viewing this apartment or doing an inspection before signing the lease due to covid).

They called us back to say that they are only doing emergency repairs and that a broken dishwasher is not an emergency. This is apparently due to low staffing because of the coronavirus. 

Obviously, we can just hand wash our dishes, but this was an advertized feature of the apartment, and we absolutely would not have moved here if we had been told there was no dishwasher or a broken dishwasher. I have done a bit of research, and as far as I can tell, repair and deduct is a potential option in California (a previous landlord refused to fix a leaking faucet for a week and I did this).

,legaladvice,"I am currently leasing an apartment in Virginia. My lease ends on May 12th and I am moving into a home I am purchasing. I submitted my intent to vacate in accordance with my lease.

I receive a notice on my door about my last months rent payment. On this notice it stated that my last month of rent wouldn't be auto withdrawn using their payment portal and I would have to pay with a check. Last week I checked my back account and their system withdrew a full months rent any way. My wife called them and they stated that it would credit my account the full rent amount. Checking the website revealed that my account wasn't credited a full months rent so I proceeded to call them.

I was told that they were holding my extra payment until we move out and they would add it in with my security deposit return and if any repairs would need to be made, they would deduct if from my extra rent. I might need the money to help with closing costs and this could be a very large problem.

My question is are they legally allowed to hold onto my ill-gotten payment and the fact that their written notice instructed me not to disable autopay seems kind of fishy. I didn't see anything in the virginia landlord - Tennant handbook or my lease about returning rent overpayment.

My husband has lived with his parents all his life, some by choice and some because his father guilt him into staying to look after his sick mom. 5 yrs ago i met my husband and about 3.5 yrs ago i moved into with him and his parents. At the time his father wanted us to help fix up the farm and get it ready to sell and he would give my husband his inhertitance to start our life together.
Oh i should add before me and my husband met his father had made a ton of promises like you will get 1/3 of the equity in the house for maintaning it and or you can have the opportunity to buy the farm for whats owing on it when you get married. Those sorts of things. So for 20 plus yrs while living at the farm my husband never paid rent by money he paid it by his time 
Running the farm was and is a full time job in its self, plus he fixed all the cars and my husband even bought all the farm equipment needed to keep the farm up.
About a yr ago there was a blow up, this was about the same time me and my husband started a business and it meant being away from the farm for weeks on end. So my husband hasnt done as much around the farm but we also arent there much either. When home we buy everything including groceries and pay for our internet ect(his dad doesnt pay a penny for anything for us) During the huge blow up his father went back on all promises, he acused my husband of living rent free and taking advantage of the situation and told him he wont see a penny of the inheritance, instead it was going to all the other kids that left the family years ago(this was fine by us cause we never cared about the money other then my husband feels as tho he wasted his life away staying here this longand should be compensated for his time.)
So my question is, the FIL tried to kick us out today over something reallly stupid, and i basically said to him he cant kick us out, we havent done anything wrong, not to mention my husbands sick mother doesnt want us to leave and shes told us many times we dont have to pay any rent because we do so much around the farm..

,legaladvice,"Some backstory:

I was freelancing in the past to develop a medical SaaS platform/tool for a doctor that has his own LLC.

Later on as in years later(after I'm done working with him) I get this job as a contractor for a medical corporation. The corp does not know anything about the previous stuff, I didn't use that as a selling point to get in.

The issue is, this SaaS thing we're still trying to get off the ground. What it does is not related to who I work for that I'm aware of.

My stepdad was killed in an accident at our home. An ambulance came but he already passed away by the time they arrived. They did not take him in the ambulance. A bill was sent to us for the ambulance in his name. Does it have to be paid? My mom and I are confused because we read California is a community property state, so they could come after the house if we don't pay it. 

Also, he was an organ donor and they used many of his organs. My mom received a bill for the organ donation from the morgue. I never heard of that before. It doesn't sound right to be charged for making a donation.

Now we are concerned about receiving more bills, like firetruck, credit cards, etc.

If I were to have an interested buyer for private party sale or if I were to trade the vehicle into a dealership.

The ground floor of the building is mainly a garage. The floor right above it is the first of three residential floors and is where I live. Some time last year the company began construction to convert the garage into new apartment units. They advertised it as ""solving the housing puzzle"" or something ridiculous like that.

As you can guess, the construction work has been incredibly disruptive. From Monday-Friday 8am-6pm, literally just below my feet is non-stop jack hammering, nailing, and sawing. If I happen to still be in my room when they are working, it is impossible to hear myself think. Luckily I have a job that allows me to work from home, but attempting it is horrendous. Business calls are impossible, and my colleagues comment that it sounds like I am ""inside hell"". I had been trying to stay in a percentage of the time due to recovering from a foot injury, but the noise has pretty much driven me out during working hours.

Anyways, fast forward to the current COVID situation. Once San Francisco's shelter-in-place orders first went out, the construction stopped which was fantastic thank god. I could not imagine being forced to quarantine in my room all day while that construction was going on, much less be able to concentrate on work. Well the calm didn't last long. Today they started rolling out plastic protection onto the floors again and posted fliers that they would resume construction next week and continue through Spring 2021. 

According to the flier: ""This work has been deemed essential by the City and County of San Francisco and is permitted to continue while the Shelter-in-Place order is active.""

This became the worst possible scenario: being trapped next to a construction site. In my opinion, it diminishes the livability of my unit. Can I legally do anything about this, such as demand some sort of compensation or challenge it?

I had been trying to stay in a percentage of the time due to recovering from a foot injury, but the noise has pretty much driven me out during working hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, fast forward to the current COVID situation. Once San Francisco&amp;#39;s shelter-in-place orders first went out, the construction stopped which was fantastic thank god. I could not imagine being forced to quarantine in my room all day while that construction was going on, much less be able to concentrate on work. Well the calm didn&amp;#39;t last long. Today they started rolling out plastic protection onto the floors again and posted fliers that they would resume construction next week and continue through Spring 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the flier: &amp;quot;This work has been deemed essential by the City and County of San Francisco and is permitted to continue while the Shelter-in-Place order is active.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This became the worst possible scenario: being trapped next to a construction site. In my opinion, it diminishes the livability of my unit. Can I legally do anything about this, such as demand some sort of compensation or challenge it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

About two months ago I got hired by a multi-billion $$ government contracting company as a Systems Administrator for a 30+ year long contract they own. After passing background, etc I was given a start date, offered a full relocation, sign on bonus (haven’t been paid), etc. When we arrived in our new location (Utah), from California, my HR rep gave me a new start date two weeks out due to an issue with my security clearance.

Throughout the last two months, I’ve been getting a run around saying they’re waiting on the government to authorize me to come onsite and start work. 

Today, two months later, I just received an email from the same rep saying the government won’t authorize me to work on the contract until my security clearance investigation is complete, which is estimated to take about 240 days. Apparently the company had overlooked the fact that my clearance was due for an investigation and authorized a start date and relocation for us anyway.

* currently the other side is vacant and they are doing showings.
* All backyard was taken over by former tenant which were owner's family and We were ok sharing.
* My current lease does not dictate that we cannot use their side of backyard-there is no specific.
* managent is asking us not to use that side bc it is directly behind of that unit, even though it is vacant.

I mean I COULD not use that space anyway when the next tenant moves in bc it is really on their side even tough we do not have the equivalent. HOWEVER it is VACANT now and they are asking me to remove my lawn furniture seems they crossed the line. I COULD remove the furniture to show the cleaner backyard for showing but I don't think I AM OBLIGATED TO.

We have separate entrance on either side. Front yard has identical portion for both of us, but back yard is asymmetrical and only the other side has flat stone floored back yard portion directly their side between their unit and garage, and we don&amp;#39;t. (&lt;a href=""https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS7az7jzjpsyb30000000000.jpg""&gt;https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/IS7az7jzjpsyb30000000000.jpg&lt;/a&gt;) Instead we have a small lawn in the middle of us and we have a small pathway to a concrete patch that leads to the detached garages for both of us. (&lt;a href=""https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISz3xv0tfhk1c30000000000.jpg""&gt;https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_f/ISz3xv0tfhk1c30000000000.jpg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in Lake Oswego, Clackamas county, Oregon. 97034.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;currently the other side is vacant and they are doing showings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All backyard was taken over by former tenant which were owner&amp;#39;s family and We were ok sharing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My current lease does not dictate that we cannot use their side of backyard-there is no specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;managent is asking us not to use that side bc it is directly behind of that unit, even though it is vacant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1 I am not sure if I am legally prohibited using that space? I mean I COULD not use that space anyway when the next tenant moves in bc it is really on their side even tough we do not have the equivalent. HOWEVER it is VACANT now and they are asking me to remove my lawn furniture seems they crossed the line. I COULD remove the furniture to show the cleaner backyard for showing but I don&amp;#39;t think I AM OBLIGATED TO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#2 Can they just show up to the property (shared yards) and take pictures of the back yard with me being there without notice? I was shocked that they just showed up and taking pictures while me and my kids were on the back yard yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone,

Roughly two days ago I received an instagram message from an account with no followers/no pictures claiming that I raped their friend as they were sleeping. This caught me completely off guard so I took this as some weird bot account I told them to screw off, that those kinds of claims aren't funny and I never would do something like that, and then blocked them.

My HR director calls me today and forwards me an email where the same instagram tag (only with an email account after it) claims that I raped them. They provide zero background or anything, just wrote my name, my position at the company, and then said I raped them and gave them an STD (not sure if its relevant but I did a physical two weeks ago and am clean). It is clear to me they found my linkedin, and thus my employer, through my name being on my instagram- so that was a rough lesson learned on internet privacy.

This is a small company and we know each other well, so HR has told me they believe me and will move on (also due to the weird email address that sent the email/their changing of my foreign name spelling in the email multiple times based on what social media they got their info on/and the lack of any detail), but that this is on the record now for liability reasons. That is fine and I get it, an accusation like this is serious. That said, I am scared of this individual continuing to send harassing emails to executives at my company if they do not receive a response from HR and my company viewing me poorly as a result.

I want to forget about this and for it to go away, but I do not want to stick my head in the sand. I've never done anything remotely close to sexual assault or taking advantage of a woman. I've had girls be upset that I didn't want to date them, but I seriously can't see any of them being this mad to try and ruin my career. I don't expect any law enforcement action against me, because I didn't do anything, but I wonder if this is something I need to report to them? I doubt they care...

Sorry guys, I'm a bit scrambled, but this is the wildest thing I've ever experienced and don't know what to do as a next step and it freaks me out. Looking back I should've just never replied to a clearly fake instagram account and painted myself as a target for who knows what....",t2_1bxsdw9k,False,,0,False,False Rape HR Email - Do I do anything?,[],r/legaladvice,False,6,,0,False,t3_gg2p7a,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,1588975698.0,,[],{},,True,,1589004085.0,text,6,,,text,self.legaladvice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;[TX]&lt;/p&gt;

Before I was officially signed onto my roommates’ lease, they told me rent was $50 extra than it actually was. I moved in mid December so I paid $175 to one of the roommates not knowing I had given her $25 extra dollars for her to keep in her pocket. It was when I signed the lease that I realized my portion of the rent was only $300. I never actually lived there (I ended up moving in with my boyfriend) but I moved furniture in. I paid Jan, Feb, March and April’s rent early. Throughout those months I also paid a portion of utilities even though I wasn’t contributing to the cost of utilities. It was when I realized they were overcharging me by nearly $40 each month in utilities that I told them I wasn’t paying anymore towards utilities if they were going to overcharge for something I wasn’t even contributing to. (One of them also stole my pillow but not wanting to cause drama, I didn’t bring it up to them). 

Here is the problem. I just paid May, June, and July in advance but got a phone call today from the apartment manager telling me that my roommates haven’t paid this month’s rent. She told me they have also been late on paying every month since they signed the lease (a $100 late fee each month). Since they haven’t been paying on time, they owe a lot in unpaid rent and it is all coming out of my payments. They are basically stealing my money as their portion of rent AND the LATE FEES from their irresponsibly is coming out of the money I have paid in advance for my portion. 

The apartment manager sent me a document that she said was posted on our apartments door (that my roommates never told me about) saying our lease would not be renewed and that if we wanted to move out before the end lease date (August 31) we could and wouldn’t be responsible for anymore rent. I asked the apartment manager if there was any way I could get my money back since I’m not living there and have paid in advance for months that I am no longer obligated to pay. She said the only way I can get the money I am owed back it to get it through my roommates.

,legaladvice,"I am located in Alberta, Canada

Bear with me here, I guess this is mostly a rant but I would like some help, if anyone knows what to do.

On April 20th, I ordered an iPad Pro 12.9” and Apple Pencil. I paid for expedited shipping and was told 3 to 5 business days for my delivery, but didn’t receive it for 10 business days. Now during all this COVID confusion, I understand that it took more time. I requested a refund on my $15 shipping charge due to the delay, which they accommodated.

I checked my account, and received the credit back for the shipping, but also received the full amount for the iPad as well. I called Apple yesterday and spent over an hour on the phone with them trying to figure out what happened. It appears that the person I spoke to about the shipping filed a shipping investigation in error, even though I did tell them that I received my iPad. 

The “supervisor” I spoke to yesterday told me that they understood that this was Apples error and made arrangements to charge me for the iPad a second time, to fix the money I was refunded in error. She identified herself as a supervisor multiple times. I told her that I would need a specific timeframe for the charge, as it would exceed the limit I have in place for online purchases. She assured me that it would be done by midnight, so I called my bank and cleared the limit until midnight yesterday. She also told me she would be sending me AirPod Pros and a gift card for the amount of time I had spent up until that point dealing with this, which I appreciated.

Today, someone from their billing department called me and told me they didn’t get to it yesterday and would try again either today, or within the next couple of days. I’m very uncomfortable with clearing my limit for any longer than a few hours as I’ve had my bank account compromised before, and also told them the name and email of the person I spoke to about my payment arrangement for the previous day. They had no record I spoke to anyone, and no notes on my account about the promises she had made me.

At this point I have no idea what to do. I contacted apple myself about their error, I made the arrangements I had to make, and I was promised compensation for the issues I’ve had. The manager I spoke to today was very short with me, and repeatedly stated that it sounded like I was refusing to pay for the iPad. I already paid for the iPad. I’ve been nothing but honest with them and tried to pay for it a second time, as ridiculous as that is.

Yesterday she received a letter in the mail from a towing company informing her that on April 18 his car was towed from the parking lot of his apartment complex.

,legaladvice,"Hi there, 

Bit of background information I’m studying at a British University and I live in a 6 bedroom house that’s privately owned, however all communication goes through the property management company I pay rent to.

I moved home at the start of lockdown (as did many other students) due to my uni being cancelled and the work moving online.

2 of my flatmates flew back to Italy a few weeks into lockdown while my other 3 flatmates continue to live in the house.

I emailed my landlord 5 days ago asking if I can get an early release from my lease as I am no longer living there and struggling with money due to being fired from my job due to COVID cutbacks and that I can take my stuff as soon as I’m allowed to.

I received a reply the next day telling me that rent is still required and if I need financial support, go to my guarantors. Fair enough, that’s what I expected.


However, I received an email from the company we pay our bills to informing us that the two Italians no longer are paying bills as they’ve provided proof of being let off the tenancy  and this shouldn’t affect us in any way (meaning I still pay my flat rate of £40 a month).


From asking one of the girls that left to Italy, she informed me the landlord has said providing she’s taken all her belongings he will cut the rent by a half.

Now where do I stand now? 

Can I hold this against them to get myself released from the lease? 

Any tips/ info is greatly appreciated.

&lt;p&gt;I emailed my landlord 5 days ago asking if I can get an early release from my lease as I am no longer living there and struggling with money due to being fired from my job due to COVID cutbacks and that I can take my stuff as soon as I’m allowed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received a reply the next day telling me that rent is still required and if I need financial support, go to my guarantors. Fair enough, that’s what I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I received an email from the company we pay our bills to informing us that the two Italians no longer are paying bills as they’ve provided proof of being let off the tenancy  and this shouldn’t affect us in any way (meaning I still pay my flat rate of £40 a month).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From asking one of the girls that left to Italy, she informed me the landlord has said providing she’s taken all her belongings he will cut the rent by a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now where do I stand now? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I hold this against them to get myself released from the lease? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tips/ info is greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers all&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Once I agreed to return to work,  my employers then told me they could only pay me for a portion of my previous hours. I wrote them an email stating that I believed that to be incorrect, as they could pay me what I was receiving prior to COVID-19.

Now they are giving me two options: Take 13.5 hours of pay when I was previously scheduled for 30, or Take the 30 hours per week but do a ton of extra work for them that is not in my contract.

Isn't the PPP supposed to keep people OFF unemployment- they wrote that their CPA told them they only have to pay me for the hours I'm actually working- 13.5. With only 13.5 hours of pay- I would still need to be on unemployment- however, most likely wouldn't receive unemployment to make up for the additional hours.

\*This is because I recently moved across the country for this job this past Winter, and was only receiving $100/ week in unemployment due to recently graduating and moving to a new state .. and unemployment was based on what I was making November 2019-December 2019. 

Several other employees at the business are getting paid while having no other work to do at home. They have been trying to get me to quit in order to avoid paying unemployment insurance- as they have a high turnaround and have laid off several people in the last few years.

Any advice is much appreciated! Its hard to find information about the PPP that isn't specifically just about what qualifies a small business to receive the loan. What are the rules about how and when its supposed to be used to pay employees? Do employees HAVE to be actually working for the exact amount of hours in order to be compensated? Is it different for each state? I am located in Colorado.

,legaladvice,"A few weeks after moving out of my old apt. (Dallas , TX) I received a bill for almost $3k. I called the apartment building and spoke to the manager who said that I had moved out on time, had given notice, and didn't owe anything. I called corporate and the agent said I didn't submit notice.

My move out date was February 1st.  In early December, I was asked by the leasing office if I planned to renew. I let them no that I would not be renewing. This was only verbal communication and not with the manager. I stopped by again on the 4th (60 days prior) to attempt to speak with the manager. The same person was there and confirmed that he had made a note of my verbal notice to move out but that I could email the manager to confirm. I sent her an email the next day - December 5th.

I forwarded the email to the corporate agent and he has now sent a new bill for $2170 -$68 rent 2/1 to 2/1$137 rent 2/2 to 2/3$1698 reletting fee

$167 utilities 11/21-2/1

$75 cleaning$23 interest accrued

I realized that the only written documentation I have is the email sent on December 5th, but it seems a  bit unfair to charge me the reletting fee after multiple verbal confirmations and speaking with the leasing manger.

,legaladvice,"Hi, like many, I never thought I would post here, and I'm not even sure if there is any legal route to take, though I'm concerned the vet has been negligent. My cat had trouble urinating (a common issue), and so we took him to the vet. He had to stay two nights (Wednesday - Friday), and have a catheter in. The first night, he removed his catheter overnight. He did the same the second night, we're not sure if they had a cone in him or implemented any additional precautions after he removed it the first night. Apparently he removed his e-collar before removing his own catheter.

Due to the pandemic, we are not able to physically enter the building, so we are unable to visit him.

We were told yesterday we would be able to pick him up today and that he had improved. After calling 3 times over two days to see what time we should pick him up, each time reception assured we would get a call back, they finally called us. Apparently, he has been quite aggressive (he's obviously in pain and terrified), and they've been keeping him in the cage as much as possible, but 10 minutes before they called, he (in their words) ""lunged at one of the technicians"" in an attempt to get off the table. The technician apparently caught him mid-air, and in the confusion his front canine was cracked to the point of needing removal.  They don't know where he hit his head, they don't know how the tooth was cracked, but they have offered to remove the tooth without charge. 

We have also just been told he needs to stay over the weekend for bladder surgery to remove bladder stones, which will occur today, and that the tooth will be removed directly after the surgery. They allegedly discovered ""pea sized"" stones that could not be passed via the catheter, and that it was discovered by an ultrasound after an x-ray (which they take when they insert the catheter to ensure it's well placed). I don't understand how this was missed over the past two x-rays and how we are only just now being informed that he needs surgery.

My concern is that, they said he had been ""feisty"" and ""aggressive"" the entire stay, so is it neglectful that they had him in a situation where he could escape and chip his tooth? We're upset he will need to have his tooth removed, we're upset we had to call several times before the vet called us back to update us, and we're upset that we were clearly told yesterday afternoon we would be able to pick him up today and that now he has to stay until the end of the weekend, costing us twice as much as the original quote.

As of Christmas Eve I had separated from my ex fiancé for gaslighting and being actually mad that I spent time in a hospital dying instead of coming to visit and be there for me. The lease on the apartment and all the bills have been a pain in the ass for me because she didn’t want anything to happen but I had to get away from the toxicity. We “agreed” that I would take her cat because she wouldn’t be able to care for it where she was moving to but in reality she put me in a situation where I couldn’t not take the cat. I gladly took her cat because I love him with all my heart and I would hate to see him go into a home with people he wasn’t comfortable with. I took a huge burden financially trying to get him moved in and he suffers from some very serious separation anxiety. She abused and mistreated this cat and he’s been so much happier since she dumped him on me. Just today she contacted me and tells me that she is coming back to get the cat. I told her through back and forth conversation that I was keeping the cat. She tried contacting my family and myself multiple times after I told her I wasn’t going to let her just barge in and take what she just left behind. Long story short I told her that if she kept trying to contact myself or my family on the matter I would be contacting an attorney. It’s been quite since. What are my steps now to prepare in case she tries to contact me or my family anymore? What do I need to do to make sure this cat is safe? What do I do if she comes to my parents house searching for me or the cat despite not being welcome there? Currently the cat is in custody of a trusted friend until I can move into my new home and I’ve been couch surfing between a couple friends and my current girlfriend and nobody really knows where I am at any given moment, does this effect anything at all?

In March of this year I decided, at the behest of my therapist, to enter a 30-day residential treatment program for substance abuse and other underlying mental health disorders.

Then two weeks into treatment, shutdowns began, me and my rehab buddies were sent home, and the retailer I worked for closed its doors before the mall it was housed in did. 

To complicate matters, my housemate who chauffeurs me to appointments, etc. is on dialysis, so hasn’t been all too keen on me working with the public just yet, though I am able and available. So I applied for unemployment on April 9, hoping to offer some help and continue paying my bills.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Legal advice to consider legal actions because I can't compete with this level of possessiveness. I also suspect negligence on the nursing home's behalf as their avoidant behavior of not answering phones in the midst of a pandemic is questionable. I would also like to know about the validity of health proxies after death and how it may impact this situation. I cannot accept being left in dark as a blood relative, not knowing where his body is.

&amp;#x200B;

What happened:

&amp;#x200B;

My father passed of COVID complications on April 29th in a Manhattan nursing home. My mom and I have been in contact with the nursing home but they refuse to provide any info on his death or funeral arrangements. In the weeks leading up to his death we phoned many times, calls were rarely answered. When my mom got through, she was told someone would get back to her but of course they didn't. When she did reach someone, they had told her he had contracted the virus, but he was okay and on oxygen (it wasn't clear whether that meant ventilator or not). Later on she was told he was on antibiotics. Eventually, we were discreetly notified of his death 5 days after his passing through a health aide personally known by my mother. His health proxy/party of contact is a woman who is abrasive, possessive, avoidant, and withholds all his information.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

&amp;#x200B;

I am 29 years old and I'm his only child, he and my mother were never married though they separated when I was a toddler (due to financial issues on his part, and my mom obtaining a job opportunity overseas &amp; his unwillingness to join her). I maintained contact with him, spent summers with him and I also lived with him for two years as a teen. His health proxy is a woman whom he dated before AND after being with my mom - that timeline is problematic news to me. This woman named 'S', has a lot of animosity towards my mom. Apparently my father left her for my mom back in the 80s, she would call my mother demanding to speak to my father. 'S' is the one who had him admitted to the nursing home in 2015 after he showed signs of dementia. She didn't bother notifying my mother. My mother instead found out from his neighbor a few weeks later when paying him a visit. My mother and I had disagreed with the idea of placing him in a nursing home, she offered to pay his rent so he can keep his apartment, have some independence, and have some sort of personal health aide. 'S' objected and gave the apartment away. She also yelled at my mom for the idea of letting me live with my dad back when I was a teen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A large part of why I'm not listed as a health proxy is likely because I became somewhat estranged from him in the last 10 years. We had a turbulent history, as he was short-tempered &amp; verbally abusive to me. For this reason, I kept my distance and was never 'ready' to visit him and reconcile although I had intended on doing so since last year. My mother had visited him every few months throughout the years.Whenever my mother encountered 'S' at the nursing home, 'S' would yell and make a scene - 'S' would tell her to stay away from my dad and stop trying to be a part of his life. According to my mother, my father didn't mind my mother's visits. There were also times where my mother inquired about being added as a proxy but was refused because of 'S'. My mother phoned 'S' this week to inquire about my father's death and her response was ""your daughter was not close to her father, leave me alone, there won't be a funeral, it's over! don't call me again!"".

&amp;#x200B;

Live in the US if that helps)

Hi, first time post here

I do my banking with TD Bank and during the month of April I miscalculated when my paycheck was coming and went into overdraft.

That’s fine, my mistake and for the money I spent I understand those charges come with the fee. 

However, I had five Venmo transactions where the money was repeatedly taken out then denied by my bank and put back.

Each time I was charged an OD fee which was never put back. It ended up equaling to over $500 in charges. Five times over what I paid Venmo in the first place.

I’m furious and called the bank asking why they allowed the charges to go through only to deny them and keep charging me fees for the same money that was ultimately never taken out.

The employee tells me they can only reverse two as a “curtesy”. I say I know that’s not true as every time I have returned an item that has put me into OD in the past the fee was also put back.

Suddenly, it then turns into “well your account won’t allow that”.

We go in circles and I ask if I can talk to someone who does know why my account won’t allow that, and apparently there’s no one higher than her in the building due to COVID. 

I said I understand but would like to at least email someone in management then. She tells me it’s not possible. Refuses to give me any way to contact someone higher up.

Magically she’s able to speak to an “ambassador” though. I ask if I can speak to them, she tells me no. Half hour on the phone and they’re still refusing. At that point I hung up before I lost my temper. 

I guess what I want to know is if there’s any way to take this further and find a way to contact someone higher up and fight this. It’s a lot of money and my fiancé and I are both furloughed for the next couple of months. 

I’m also angry because I know it’s a blatant lie that there’s no one above her that I can speak to. I hate confrontation and this whole thing has me upset.

I really appreciate any help. I guess I just want to know if it’s a lost cause or not.

,legaladvice,"Hello everyone I could use some help with this situation I’m in. For some background: I (19M) recently got a new job at a marketing agency. With everything going on I considered myself very lucky to have gotten hired here just days before everything shut down. I am a freshman in college going for a computer science major so this job really fit me and my degree. 

I met my boss after 1 phone call where he hired me on as a 1099 contractor. I was perfectly okay with this as I like contract work more than actual jobs. However, about 6 weeks later the virus started sweeping the nation he wanted me to come on as a full-time W2 employee. This was exciting because I’ve never had a full time job before. Especially exciting because of the projects I will get to work on. 

Now for a little more context: I had been paid a single paycheck throughout this 6 week period. Contractors are paid monthly instead of every 2 weeks. So I was expecting another payment in about another 2 weeks. 

However, he informed me that because he was moving me from a 1099 to a W2, that the IRS would find this very sketchy and they would audit him. He informed me that he would have to increase my pay for one pay period and that I would have to pay back the equivalent of whatever I made in the first month of being hired. This ended up being about $1,600. I don’t really know anything about the IRS or why this would look sketchy but I agreed. This is when he informed me that I wouldn’t be paid for 2 weeks that I had worked before the transition. I had worked about 120 hours in those two weeks. So it would have come out to about $750. That might not be a big paycheck for some people but that’s a car payment and half of a month of rent for me. 

And then, after all that, he tells me that he’s not going to be increasing my pay and IN FACT I’m going to be a a salaried employee so I will be only paid for 40 hours a week. So not only am I losing the 2 weeks of pay, I’m also going to have to pay back the first $1,600 so in all I am having to give up about $2,350???

Can someone explain to me what is happening and what the heck I can do to keep from losing this money? I know everyone is going to tell me to quit but I really can’t afford that right now. This is the only workplace in town that goes with my major, also everywhere else is closing or going out of business due to the virus.

,legaladvice,"Needed some help with a situation I am in, not sure whether this is the correct group but I will give it a try :) sorry for the long post, it is a little complicated! 

My dad rented a low-roof 8 seater van from a local car rental company (in B.C) Jul 2019. He signed the contract, got the keys, inspected the vehicle; but when he got in the van ready to leave to pick up our family that had landed at the airport, he was stopped and asked to take another vehicle. He waited for an 1.5 hrs for this other vehicle to arrive, at this point our family was extremely concerned since they didn't have a mode of communication to contact us. Once this new vehicle arrived, it was a high roof 8 seater van, that my dad was not comfortable driving, but they essentially forced him to take it. When he asked them to draw up a contract for it which includes damage protection for the roof + under carriage, the employees said they were too swamped and would take care of it later. It had been 2 hours at this point, so my dad asked them to draw up the contract again but it was going to take longer so he left to get my family.   


After a couple days of driving this vehicle, as my dad was pulling into a hotel, the roof of the hotel was extremely low and it damaged the top of this high roof vehicle. He immediately took it back to the car rental company and told them about the damage and the manager said that he had a friend who would get it fixed and we could settle this between us. We tried calling the manager to get updated repeatedly but received no word. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Jan 2020, my dad was out of the country in his home town on his pre-planned trip but was experiencing some health issues that he was dealing with when we received a 'Final Demand' Legal Notice from the head quarters of this rental company, demanding almost $16,500 for damages. They claimed we had ignored their previous letters (which we never got) so they had their paralegal send this final notice threatening to take us to court. Over e-mail communication, we kept giving them an update about my dad's health condition and his inability to deal with the issue when he wasn't in Canada but they kept pressurizing us and kept using threatening language. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we requested them to send over the documentation, they sent us an unsigned contract with paperwork that was evidently manipulated. Majority of the paperwork had mistakes &amp; wrong information -  for example: they have a damage estimate document from a local garage that they got the car fixed from dated Sept. 2019 but they have attached a final demand notice dated 3 days after the incident happened (Jul 2019) with the $16,500. They also have a damage waiver document with the information for the Low Roof van that we never even rented. 

&amp;#x200B;

So given this background, do we have a solid case against this company to fight them in small claims court. What kind of a lawyer should we consult? Has anyone had an experience like this?

&lt;p&gt;I applied for unemployment for my 2nd part time job (unrelated to the employer in question) and discovered that ESD had no record of my hours and wages from the employer in question, therefore I was entitled to very little compensation as my 2019 income outside of that job was very low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has told me many times that she will provide my W2 and I have kept asking. I’ve asked her for an explanation about unemployment taxes and she hasn’t responded. I’m still hoping that there’s some other explanation and that I won’t have to go through with some remedy but that’s looking less likely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking for guidance about how to proceed with this and what the outcome may look like. Thanks for your time and whatever help you may be able to offer!&lt;/p&gt;

That ended with the police being called on him and arresting him with domestic violence. My wife decided not to press charges but the city prosecutor went after him anyways because he was being a ""jackass and needed to learn his lesson."". Things have cooled down a little bit since then or so we thought. 


Fast forward to now and my wife and I are outside the US and won't be back anytime soon due to covid-19. Before leaving we had our mail sent to his house and forgot to forward our mail after what happened last year. We made less than $24,000 last year and should've been sent a stimulus check for $2,400, which would be extremely helpful for us right now. 


We called him to ask if our check was sent to him. He said our check arrived and said that he could go to his good friend, who's a branch manager at his credit union, and he could help us get our money. His dad tried to convince my wife to send him a message via messenger and he said it was all the bank needed. A message authorizing my father-in-law to cash the check so he could wire us the money. My wife sent a brief message but this is without her signature. 5 minutes after her dad said he had the half of the cashed check and he was going to wire the money to us. 10 minutes later he said that he would only send $700 to us and give us the rest when we fly back to the US. Obviously we said no and he should send us all our money. That turned into an argument and ended with him saying that he wouldn't send us our money. We haven't heard from him since.


Later we then found out that he made an arrangement with his friend, even before we asked about the check, that the bank demanded 50% of the check for him to be able to cash it. We don't have any accounts with that credit union anymore so we don't owe them anything.


We not sure what we can do or what we should do since we are outside the US right now and won't be back for a while.

My mom just told me that on Sunday the police will come to our house and arrest my mom for something.

Hello there, for a bit of context my then-significant-other drove my vehicle and got into an accident. I got an estimate of the repairs, of which they said they would pay me back. Nearly two years later, we break up.

Before moving (Still in California) I throw together a contract and have her sign it. Here's a paraphrase

&amp;#x200B;

* I, (Ex), agree to make whole the damages inflicted upon (OP) due to (Getting in a crash).
* It is agreed and understood by both parties that (Ex) will attempt to repair or replace (explicit damage) before (OP) leaves the city.
* If repairs cannot be made in time, (Ex) agrees to pay the sum estimate required for repairs, minus any amount (OP) owes (Ex).
* It is agreed that (Ex) will pay full amount by (DATE\_SOON) or else (5% Monthly Interest on principle and accrued interest)
* If (OP) Determines there is no good faith effort by (EX) to follow the contract, (OP) reserves right to claim whole amount owed, including interest and any costs applied in an attempt to reclaim amount owed.

This is signed and dated by both parties twice; Once at the origin of the contract, and a second time when I had given them a bit of cash, effectively making the amount they owed me more.

Spoke to HOA this morning, who said our complex has a subjugation clause, so owner to owner we can’t battle it out - my insurance company can’t go after her insurance company for reimbursement. He said I have three options:

* Get repairs to drywall done at my own cost, pay up front
* Go through my own insurance to pay for drywall repair
* Wait it out and see if floor 3 steps up and her insurance pays for drywall repair 

(But it seems like for the second or third options, I'm still fronting cost.)

The mold removal, on the other hand, is not covered by any of our insurance. The HOA paid for removal up front, and will be charging it to 3. He said, “We’ll try to charge her. We have limitations. We haven’t had problems before, we do this a lot. There’s a good chance we can get everything from her. But in the even that for some reason she won’t pay, we’ll come to you for payment.” 

I’m so lost. 

1. Should I go to the HOA to ask to know what they will do to try and ""force"" her to pay? (I've never dealt with something like this. Don't know if they will threaten legal action...)
2. If she refuses to pay, can the HOA just turn around and ask *me* to pay instead? What if I refuse? Am I responsible because it's my unit, even though damage was caused by another unit and it was proven? 
3. Is there any documentation I should be looking for? CC&amp;R's... local laws... I don't even know! 
4. At what point would I begin to look into legal action? Do I even have any options? I thought maybe small claims court, but just Googled it and it appears the minimum is $10,000 which, even between floors 1 and 2, wouldn't cover (my mold removal is about $1,600)

,legaladvice,"Hello!
Obligatory on mobile. First time poster. In US/Utah.

Anyway. I'm in the middle of a nasty divorce with an abusive man. I have a protective order against him and he's violated it 3 times. He's having a hearing in a month for that (it's a 3rd degree felony since it's his third violation).  Anyway, he's a violent mfer who will keep pushing the boundaries as long as he thinks he can get away with it. When he and I separated, I predicted everything he would do and I begged the court to listen. He has done everything I said he will do. I know this man very well.

We have almost 50/50 split custody of our daughter (she spends more nights at my house so it's closer to 60/40). She comes home with bleeding diaper rashes, open sores on her neck and in sensitive areas, bruising on her thighs, bruises around her rib cage that are very clear hand prints, she's hungry, her diaper is full to the max, rashes all over her body, and he won't treat her very easily treated eczema. She's usually filthy, and this goes back to before she could even walk. When we were married he would shake her, get angry so fast when she would cry and refuse to feed her until she ""changed her attitude.""

Whenever I file a police report or an abuse report, he will file one right after me to make it seem like we're just going back and forth. The police Dept knows me by name at this point and nobody is taking me seriously. Not even the child protective services.

I have filed 2 child protective orders. One last year when she came back with bruising along her tummy. I picked the WRONG attorney for that and he bullied me into dropping the  CPO and agreeing to the parent time arrangement we have now. I filed the second one recently because of the bruises around her rib cage. I took pictures, I reported it to our child protective services (they haven't reached back out either), I asked specifically for a Guardian ad litem to be appointed. We had our hearing recently and NOBODY looked at the pictures I submitted as evidence and they said there was no evidence of child abuse. But you can CLEARLY SEE HAND PRINTS on my baby. My attorney couldn't be there so I asked for and was granted a continuance.

After talking to my lawyer (and 4 others prior to this one because of all the bs my ex is putting me through), he said that this specific commissioner only does what is easy, not exactly what is right. One of the lawyers I worked with before said that they went in for a hearing and the commissioner hadn't even looked at the case prior to walking in the court room. They all pretty much had the same opinion that she's not doing her job and the court cases to prove it but they're scared to do anything about it because of retaliation.

This has been going on for months and the bruises and other marks my husband leaves on our baby are just getting worse. His hearing for the most recent violation will result in jail time and he's terrified of going to jail. I haven't even touched on his mental issues, but he is fucked up in the head. He doesn't even see the same reality that we do, he overdoses on his panic attack meds and sleeps for days, he can't hold a job, he can't find stable living conditions for the life of him,  he's attempted suicide twice while we were married, he was institutionalized the year we met (before we met) for attempting suicide.

Anyway, I'm legitimately terrified that he's going to kill my daughter and himself before his hearing. And the court is doing nothing about the obvious bruises on her body because of how ""back and forth"" it seems with everything my husband is shooting back at me. From an outside perspective, yes, it looks like we're just trying to get back at each other. But if the court would just LOOK at the bruises he leaves on her body and LOOK at the utter bullshit he puts in his police reports and the actual evidence I have to refute it, they would see that he's a fucking psycho who is hurting a toddler.

His lawyer is making me out to be this spurned ex wife who is just filing protective orders to fuck with him. He LIED saying that I had file multiple protective orders for myself in order to get one granted (I filed ONE and I got it) and that I've just been continually filing CPO after CPO and I've only filed two. The first one was dropped because my lawyer at the time was a fucking manipulative dick.

This same commissioner is handling my divorce too.... I don't want that to happen because nothing will be done. There is not ""best interest of the child"" it's ""fastest way to get this off my plate.""

I want to keep my daughter safe. What can I do? I know I can't run away with her. Our next hearing will be via telephone so there's no way to shove the paper of evidence in front of the commissioner/GAL's face and MAKE them look at what he's doing to her. My attorney is floored by what happened because of the overwhelming evidence I have and he intends to make sure everyone looks at the pictures and evidence. I'm just at a loss for how I can protect my child because they've already made up their minds about this whole thing. They continued it as a formality so that I could have representation when they dismiss the damn thing.

Is there an agency that can help? A group? Something? My daughter will die if my husband has unrestricted access to her.

EDIT: I have taken her to the hospital to have them document it. The only one I didn't take her in for was the most recent bruising because they aren't taking me seriously and I was scared to talk to anyone except my lawyer. That was stupid of me, yes, but the rest of the evidence speaks for itself too. All my doctor is willing to do is write a note saying ""change her more often, bathe her, don't squeeze her,"" but he won't actually DO anything. I've tried submitting that note as evidence, but evidence only works if they look at it.

EDIT 2: I did take her to the Children's Justice Center and showed them my pictures of the most recent bruises. They told me to file a police report and I did. The nurse there was very concerned over it and reported it to her hospital's group but I guess she didn't do anything else since she knew I would report it? I don't know. I promise you guys, I have kept a meticulous record of everything.

Obligatory on mobile. First time poster. In US/Utah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I&amp;#39;m in the middle of a nasty divorce with an abusive man. I have a protective order against him and he&amp;#39;s violated it 3 times. He&amp;#39;s having a hearing in a month for that (it&amp;#39;s a 3rd degree felony since it&amp;#39;s his third violation).  Anyway, he&amp;#39;s a violent mfer who will keep pushing the boundaries as long as he thinks he can get away with it. When he and I separated, I predicted everything he would do and I begged the court to listen. He has done everything I said he will do. I know this man very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have almost 50/50 split custody of our daughter (she spends more nights at my house so it&amp;#39;s closer to 60/40). She comes home with bleeding diaper rashes, open sores on her neck and in sensitive areas, bruising on her thighs, bruises around her rib cage that are very clear hand prints, she&amp;#39;s hungry, her diaper is full to the max, rashes all over her body, and he won&amp;#39;t treat her very easily treated eczema. She&amp;#39;s usually filthy, and this goes back to before she could even walk. When we were married he would shake her, get angry so fast when she would cry and refuse to feed her until she &amp;quot;changed her attitude.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I file a police report or an abuse report, he will file one right after me to make it seem like we&amp;#39;re just going back and forth. The police Dept knows me by name at this point and nobody is taking me seriously. Not even the child protective services.&lt;/p&gt;

I just started a brand new job in a non profit agency working with vulnerable (homeless) people. 

I've done this type of work for several years, and I'm aware of the risks involved, but I'm only a few days in, but already seeing *massive* red flags with this company - some of which I won't discuss here. What I do want to ask about is the change in job description. 

The description and contract I signed indicated mostly working with external partners, minimal (but some) direct contact with clients. Within my first week of working, I was told that I would actually be working in a warehouse, sorting donations that are coming in.  My contract indicates that my regular working days would be Mon-Fri 9-5 with *some* availability for evenings and weekends, but I've now been told I will be working evenings and weekends on a regular basis. I was also told pretty directly that the reason I was hired under the original contract was because there is no funding provided for the warehouse/labour role I am now in. 

I don't want to get too 'in the weeds' with the details of the job, but I'm basically wondering if it's legal for an organization to hire me for a stated position, and then immediately change the duties.

&amp;#x200B;

Timeline -

End of March - Moved Out.

April 27 - Left an email with my property managers. She said she will contact corporate. However, no response back.

April 28 - Went to corporate office's website and use their message form to send a message regarding my security deposit. Stated that I wanted to be contacted by email, but left my phone number on the message also. No answer on that end as of today.

April 29 - Contacted property managers. Property managers noted that the security deposited has apparently been mailed out on April 17 and I should wait another week before calling again to resend another check.

May 7 - Still no check. I reached out. Property managers state they will contact corporate office.

May 8 (today) - I reached out to the property manager and she stated that right after I got off the phone with her, she contacted corporate, but she was not able to get in contact. I also tried reaching out to the corporate office, tried calling the number on their website and it is directing me leave a voicemail on a mailbox that is full...

&amp;#x200B;

I know in California, landlords are required to send the security deposit within 21 days after moving out. At this point, am I obligated to the full security deposit? I know they stated that they mailed it out on April 17, but there is no proof of that because I never received the mail.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to send a demand letter by certified mail for the full security deposit (if possible, dependent on the above question), but wondering where I should send it to since it is stated by the property managers that everyone in the office is working from home due to the ongoing pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I am doing all the steps I can atm. Anything else I should be doing?

,legaladvice,"Good afternoon,

Going to preface this with a TL;DR -- Our dog bit a delivery driver's finger. Why is the cost of an average dog bite so high, and what should I expect to pay in terms of damages? Should we communicate with the risk management company?

Long story:

My dog is incredibly protective since we moved to our new apartment, so we have been being extra cautious. We opt for contactless delivery in every case, and we wait several minutes after their call to get the food -- so our dog doesn't associate someone approaching the new door with a stranger. Unfortunately, our delivery driver forgot an item, and returned to place it as the door was opened. With the driver's hand being directly in front of our dog's face, he bit the driver's finger and ran away.

I mostly needed to preface that to assuage my shame, as it pains me to come across as an irresponsible dog co-parent, and if I didn't provide detail, I probably wouldn't have been able to post this at all.

I immediately crated the dog and helped administer first aid. The driver was shaken, so I helped him calm down, cleaned his wound, and helped him bandage it. I ensured he had my contact information, I offered the information on our dog's shots (which are kept up-to-date), and I contacted our county's animal control to report the bite.

When I spoke with my renter's insurance, I discovered that our policy does not cover animal bites. So, at this point, I am concerned because the average price for a dog bite (according to a google search) is in the tens of thousands of dollars. I expected to cover the price of a finger wound, so my first question is: Why are dog bites so expensive?

My second question is: What happens in the case where the risk management company for the delivery driver demands that I pay tens of thousands of dollars that I simply do not have? For some reason, I doubt that ""reasonable monthly payments"" is in the realm of possibility. Technically, his owner is unemployed due to the coronavirus.

Finally, should I communicate with the risk management company? As I might have expected, they have been aggressive and threatening throughout the encounter. They called my partner's phone, refused to identify themselves, and demanded to speak with me -- threatening my partner with court when he refused to hand the phone over when they wouldn't identify themselves. (I only identified them by searching the phone number on google after the fact. I am assuming they got the phone number from the delivery app.). Other than the phone call, they have sent a letter seeking ""reimbursement for the cost of the medical treatment and expenses associated with this incident."" Should I communicate and cooperate with them, or what is your advice?

I apologize that this post ran long -- I am not sure what information is relevant, and which information is not. I sincerely appreciate any assistance.

,legaladvice,"Hello. Here is my current situation.

I am renting a home with a large yard in Oregon. I have an old shed and a chicken coop in my back yard. My next door neighbors have a massive fir and white oak that are close to the property line, with the limbs hanging over our yard about 70/30 compared to what hangs over theirs. The white oak is dangerously close to the main power line and the power line split off that runs to our home. The fir hangs directly over my shed and chicken coop and every fall I am stuck cleaning 100% of the mess left behind by their oak tree. Recently, they had they had an arborist over to trim some other firs in the yard. While the property owners were here (they live a ways away and currently rent their house), I pointed out the oak and fir trees and asked if they could have the arborists trim them back as well. They said OK.

&lt;p&gt;I am renting a home with a large yard in Oregon. I have an old shed and a chicken coop in my back yard. My next door neighbors have a massive fir and white oak that are close to the property line, with the limbs hanging over our yard about 70/30 compared to what hangs over theirs. The white oak is dangerously close to the main power line and the power line split off that runs to our home. The fir hangs directly over my shed and chicken coop and every fall I am stuck cleaning 100% of the mess left behind by their oak tree. Recently, they had they had an arborist over to trim some other firs in the yard. While the property owners were here (they live a ways away and currently rent their house), I pointed out the oak and fir trees and asked if they could have the arborists trim them back as well.

My girlfriend moved in just over a month ago. I spoke to my landlord before she did and we had her added to the lease as an occupant. 

Recently, because of COVID-19 impacting her work and other issues, my girlfriend’s doctor recommended she get a pet to help alleviate some symptoms of anxiety and depression (my GF absolutely loves cats and always lived with them before moving to my city about nine months ago). Unfortunately, my lease has a no pet policy and says they are forbidden. It goes on to say that if a pet is present without written permission from the landlord, we can be fined a great amount. The HOA for this condo complex also forbids pets for renters. 

I thought that was it, so we let it rest. On her next doctor’s appointment she informed him of this restriction and he said we should get an ESA. He wrote her a letter to show our landlord. 

I hadn’t really heard of an ESA before and neither did my girlfriend, but we did a bit research and it seemed like a good option. 

I sent my landlord an email on Tuesday, April 28th, which said:

“I hope you are doing well. 

I am writing to request an accommodation to allow an emotional support animal (ESA) at [x]. My partner has been working closely with her doctor and he believes that an emotional support animal would benefit her greatly. The ESA would be a cat.

Attached is a letter from her mental health professional which verifies her disability-related need for the assistance animal.

Let me know if there is anything else we can do or need to provide.”

Normally I would hear back from my landlord within hours of initiating contact, maybe a day at most. After the above email, though, days went by without contact. On Friday, May 1, I sent her a text message asking if she had received the email or if I should send it to another email address I had on hand for her. She responded a few minutes later with “Got it. Thanks.”

That’s the last communication I’ve had. There still hasn’t been a response to the initial email. 

We’ve since learned that people have abused ESA requests to get animals into places that forbid them, and now I’m a bit worried that my landlord is miffed. I’m fully willing to cover any potential damages the cat might do to the property, and I figured we would work that out in subsequent emails. 

But we just haven’t heard back. Which leaves two basic options, I think — she’s doing research on her end to see if an ESA is mandated and a reply is still forthcoming (and she’s potentially annoyed with me for asking, but what’s done is done I suppose) OR she was a bit late to respond because she was busy and her short text was essentially confirming that the ESA is okay. The latter doesn’t seem very realistic, as my GF and I figured there was some paperwork or modification to the lease that would be necessary, but we aren’t absolutely sure.

We also aren’t sure how to word a follow-up email to her about this, if the former is the case. My GF still is suffering from anxiety and depression and I’m about to start heading into work again after spending the last two months working from home, thus leaving her alone for most of the day since she lost her job. A cat would absolutely make a big difference for her mental health. 

Any advice on this? Or how to approach a follow up email? I guess I’m having trouble writing another email because I can’t quite figure out the balance between inquiring about her response to the request while also not ceding too much, since everything we’ve seen about legitimate ESA requests seems pretty pro-tenant.",t2_4uva7ibs,False,,0,False,Ambiguous situation with landlord about ESA?,[],r/legaladvice,False,6,,0,False,t3_gfyncf,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Landlord Tenant Housing,False,0,,False,,1588962846.0,,[],{},,True,,1588991397.0,text,6,,,text,self.legaladvice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!

I know a lot of people who use this book narration service and it seems to me this overcharging is probably widespread and has potentially gone unnoticed by other customers. Beyond getting a refund from customer support is there anything I can do to get this overcharging practice to stop?

I recently placed a small transaction with a major online retailer for an e-book. After completing the transaction I was offered an audio narration of the book for a discount because I had bought the e-book. I purchased through the offer notification and then found out I was charged for the product more than four times the price I had been quoted.

I inquired with customer support and was told that ""Since the title was pre-ordered you were charged the regular price of the audiobook"" no mention of the original price I was quoted. so I was quoted one price and charged a completely separate amount about four times what I was expecting. The kicker was that the amount I was charged isn't even close to the price *after* release, which was about twice what I paid. I feel that I can reproduce these results with any pre-order transaction with their system, so this was no accident.

I'm not sure how detailed I should be, but here's a quick example:

,legaladvice,"Hello fellas,

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, apologies if this is not the right place to post this but I feel like I could talk about this subject in a couple different subreddits, if not then please accept my apologies.

Here is the backstory:  


I purchased services from a media ""company"" that offers video montages.  
All in all, they made me a montage video using my product and my product only is in the video.  
None of their faces are shown and nothing else but the product and them using it can be seen (and yes them using it shows only their hands)  


Now the trick is that I paid for that video without an invoice or any contract at all (rookie mistake I know) and now they want to Copyright my video that is posted on YouTube only, no TV commercials or anything, YouTube only.  


My question stands here, is there anything I can do against it or can they just copyright it freely since they produced it ? Even though it is my product that is in the video.

Thank you everyone for taking your time to read this, if you need any more information I will be here asap :)  


Best wishes,

Daniel

I need unbiased legal advice. I have major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. When my son was three, I was sent to a pain management clinic for endometriosis and put on oxycodone. I became dependent on it, and was much less functional while on oxycodone all day. That made my mental illness spiral out of control. I went to an inpatient mental health facility and did ECT, and during that time my parents called CPS. CPS investigated me, and found no reason to take my child. But, my father is a legal professional and my mother is a teacher, and at the time I was unstable and could not provide for my son the way he deserved. I agreed to allow my parents to be the primary conservators of my son with the understanding this was just until I could get on my feet. Yes, I was stupid to believe them, but I cannot rewind. 

My son is now 9. In six years I got off of the pain medications, got my mental illnesses stabilized, went back to college and obtained my bachelor’s degree, started a new career doubling my income, became completely self sufficient. I have maintained my stability for 3 years. When I got my own place, I moved into an apartment less than 2 minutes of a drive from my parents house. I have seen my son nearly every day for 5 years. I go to my parents house after work everyday and stay until he goes to bed at 8:30 pm. He was spending the night irregularly when it was convenient for my mom or she was in a good mood, otherwise she makes excuses. Our order doesn’t currently provide me the amount of time I do get to see him, so if I tell her the order allows me every other weekend, she argues that the order doesn’t allow me to come over every day to see him and she will happily abide by the order meaning less time with my son for me. 

I have recently been requesting to change the order. I feel as if I am in a good enough position to have joint custody with my parents, with alternating weeks of visitation. However, with my father being a well known legal professional in our county, and my mother’s perception of me, I’m terrified I am going to upset them, lose all of the extra time I have with my son now, and a judge say the current order should stand.

I have drafted the Modification of Custody Order with my suggestion of alternating weeks, and I want to provide those to my parents and ask if we can civilly agree on this.

My A/C in my home wasn’t very cold, so I got this companies number from a friend and they came out to check the unit. The HVAC tech told me I had low freon and so he filled it up. I received a bill within the next week and I paid it.

A month later the same issue popped up, so I called them again and asked them to check for a freon leak. They “looked” but couldn’t find anything and just filled up the freon, I was kind of annoyed but it’s not my area of expertise, so I paid the second bill.

Another month goes by and once again my A/C isn’t cooling very well. I call the same company and tell them I obviously have a leak and I need them to come and fix it. Not fixed once again, so this time I didn’t pay the bill when I received it.

I called a different company at that point and within an hour the new guy took me out and showed me the super obvious spot where the leak was coming from.

Over the course of another month I kept getting bills in the mail and I would call and ask to speak to someone to explain my situation, but somehow the phone operator was never able to get someone in charge on the phone, and I was never called back, despite being told they would pass my message along and my call would be returned.

Over the next year I received a reminder for the outstanding balance once in a while, but they came
less and less often and then stopped altogether.

Now that he is out of prison, he is suing (I think?) me, his moms company, and 8 other homeowners in the area that bought homes from the mother’s company. He is saying the sales are fraudulent, because his signature was forged.

I basically asked him what was going on and he told me that the properties were stolen to him and that his signature was forged on the deeds. I was like well, I had no knowledge of that. I just bought the house as a first time homeowner and everything seemed legit. 

He was like no, so and so warned you. I said no.... no one ever warned me about this. And had they, I wouldn’t have bought the house.  He got a slightly hostile, but it ended cordially.

We've had them installed since mid-March but i have photos of the entire flat without them before that date.

I've had a look in my contract and have found no mention of fire or smoke alarms but feel like this can't be allowed. Continued negligent behaviour from the landlord putting tenants at risk seems serious to me.

,legaladvice,"Not for me, but for my best friend who doesn't have reddit. 

He's a student and resident at a public university in Florida. 3 years ago, he was working for the campus night-time safety transportation service. Basically, it's a number students can call if they feel unsafe walking on campus at night. They use golf carts as their mode of transportation. He was and still is a part-time employee of this place. 

So 3 years ago, he was driving the cart, transporting a student on campus. There are poles on crosswalks so golf carts can get through, but will stop cars from turning onto the sidewalks. So as he was driving (not very fast), he bumps one of these poles (not super hard) and the passenger fell off the back of the cart. He wasn't texting or doing anything wrong. The golf cart also didn't have any visible damage but it was already scuffed up from a bit of wear and tear so it's hard to see what was created. No visible dents though.

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a student and resident at a public university in Florida. 3 years ago, he was working for the campus night-time safety transportation service. Basically, it&amp;#39;s a number students can call if they feel unsafe walking on campus at night. They use golf carts as their mode of transportation. He was and still is a part-time employee of this place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So 3 years ago, he was driving the cart, transporting a student on campus. There are poles on crosswalks so golf carts can get through, but will stop cars from turning onto the sidewalks. So as he was driving (not very fast), he bumps one of these poles (not super hard) and the passenger fell off the back of the cart. He wasn&amp;#39;t texting or doing anything wrong. The golf cart also didn&amp;#39;t have any visible damage but it was already scuffed up from a bit of wear and tear so it&amp;#39;s hard to see what was created. No visible dents though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl is filing suit against the university and against him for negligence and under/uninsured driving. He has a valid FL driver&amp;#39;s license and has attended all the trainings for the place he worked. Any help would be appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,So 2 years ago my cousin helped me get my first car (I’m currently 22 and she’s 3 years older). We got the car completely in her name so I know legally it’s her car. I would pay her the payments for the car and everything was okay. We talked about switching the car over to my name and have me pay off the rest of my payments but the timing to go to these meetings would never work out. In February the cars engine over heated and needed a new engine entirely. The insurance we got with the car dealership said they would pay for some of the repairs at this time my cousin also was very pushy about switching the car over to my name but I kept telling her if we did the insurance wouldn’t pay nothing since that’s what they told me. We came to some agreement and waited till the car was fixed. Then the corona virus stoped the work on the car and the mechanic barely just opened up Monday and told me the amount I had to pay to fix the car. I didn’t have the money so I told him I’ll call him back when I did. Today my cousin sent me a very aggressive text saying that if she didn’t see the car today she would reported stolen and say I stole it.

I didn't think too much about him, and we didn't see each other for a year and a half, until a couple months ago when I was doing routine maintenance for the leasing company I work for and I walked into a house to fulfill a work order and he was sitting on the couch. Turns out he had moved off of campus into that house a couple months prior and he was now one of my employer's tenants. We exchanged pleasantries and I finished the work order, but the next day I was called into my bosses office and told I was put on suspension because a tenant said that I made him feel unsafe. A couple days later they had a meeting with him, he told them about the beef between us, and they decided to let me go because corporate has a policy that if a staff member and a resident has any sort of conflict, they are to fire the staff because of the liability that comes with us possessing master keys and personal information.

I immediately told both my therapist and the administrator that I had lost my insurance and that I wouldn’t be able to continue therapy. My counselor and therapist offered to see me at a reduced cash rate because “it was unethical to abandon a client at a time of crisis.“

I continued therapy for a year, paying the new cash rate each time. After one year though, both the therapist and the administrator left the practice so I was unable to continue there.

Apparently, they were attempting to bill my insurance for the sessions over the last 18 months even though I told them I had no insurance, and the insurance company and/or the office is demanding that I pay in full.

The new administrator, who I’ve never met before, says that the therapist and administrator before were not authorized to offer me a sliding scale rate and that I now owe them for services rendered since the insurance company has refused to pay.

Mississippi

TLDR: How to request reimbursement from the dog's owner? I don't know them but I have name &amp; number from police report.

Update: after a couple calls and an internet search, rabies in land animals in Mississippi is extremely rare. I feel less concerned about that aspect but I'm still curious about the best way to seek damages.

Full details:
I was bitten by a dog on my way home from work on my bicycle yesterday. Police arrived, took my statement and photos on the wounds and damage to my bike a clothing. My spouse picked me up, we rinsed off the wound and I went to the hospital for a tetanus booster, an antibiotic and proper wound care.

Today I called the vet that the police passed onto me as the animal's caregiver. The vet told me they administer vaccines that need annual renewals and this dog hasn't received theirs since 2016. I know rabies is rare but how nervous should I be  (maybe I'll crosspost to askmedical)?

The hospital (all walkins within an hour+ of me were closed) is going to cost me around $500. The dog put a whole in a pair of jeans, approximately $50. Damage to my bike would be about $50. And a new screen for my phone is probably $100. 

Is it worth pursuing reimbursement with the dog's owner? If so, how would I do that? Should I call the owner directly from the number on their police report? Such a small amount doesn't seem worth hiring an attorney, but I'd appreciate any advice you have!

Addendum: this is a nuisance dog. I've called police 4 times previously before for this same animal and never for any other dog in my life. Before yesterday they never responded in any meaningful way, or at all. Yesterday's office was excellent.",t2_156ssi,False,,0,False,Bitten by a dog!

Im from sacramento county in Ca.

TLDR; Who is responsible for pest control, tenant or landlord? 

We moved into our current rental in April 2020. The more time we’ve spent here we have noticed whenever it warms up that we have a wasp issue INSIDE the house, we do not have any windows open since moving in, nor do we leave doors open at all. We suspect they are coming in from the attic as there is a door to access it in one of the bedrooms and they’re usually in that bedroom or coming from the bottom of that bedroom door. Window is sealed and in good condition and we’ve also seen wasps go into cracks/spaces on the outside of the house so could be accessing the interior anywhere. 

Today my cat caught a mouse and he is strictly an indoor cat. We do not leave food out at all, we do not have any abnormal amount of trash, literally one small bin in the kitchen which is taken out pretty much every other day and food is rarely put in there anyway. Our trash bin outside is taken every week and is never full. I know that we are not the cause is what I’m getting at. 

This is extremely concerning to me as I’m pregnant and will soon have an infant in the home which I do not want exposed to any of that let alone have to worry that my infant may be stung by a wasp or bitten by a mouse while asleep. 

I want to contact my landlord and ask that it be taken care of but I’m curious who is actually responsible for pest control before I ask the landlord. If I’m responsible then I will be taking care of it myself of course but would definitely prefer not to have to pay to take care of an infestation not caused by me.

,legaladvice,"Probably a simple and boring question but I don't want to screw this up:

My ex-wife and I were divorced 8 years ago and as a term of the divorce she was to sign a quitclaim deed to remove her name from the deed of our marriage property.

We never filed the paperwork and now years have passed and I was about to refinance my home, and whoops her name is on there still. 

We have filled out a Kentucky specific quitclaim deed that I downloaded from eforms.com.  From there I was directed to a form called the consideration agreement
&gt; Consideration Certificate – Must be attached to the Quit Claim Deed before recording at the County Clerk’s Office.

 which says this:

&gt; Use this form if “Gift” or “Nominal Consideration” is stated on the Deed. Transfer
tax is due on the Value of said property

The consideration agreement talks about buyers and sellers and tax -- there is no buyer or seller here, she is just having her name removed from the deed.  Is this consideration agreement required? If so how do I fill it out?

&lt;p&gt;My ex-wife and I were divorced 8 years ago and as a term of the divorce she was to sign a quitclaim deed to remove her name from the deed of our marriage property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never filed the paperwork and now years have passed and I was about to refinance my home, and whoops her name is on there still. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have filled out a Kentucky specific quitclaim deed that I downloaded from eforms.com.  From there I was directed to a form called the consideration agreement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consideration Certificate – Must be attached to the Quit Claim Deed before recording at the County Clerk’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which says this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use this form if “Gift” or “Nominal Consideration” is stated on the Deed. Transfer
tax is due on the Value of said property&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

,legaladvice,"Hi me and my now ex bought a house last year (August) for £140,000 things were ok at first but as time went on she become very controlling telling me what i can and can't do in my own home, yelling at me in front of her family for trivial things like walking past her in the hallway saying its dangerous, or yelling at me for not cleaning her blender to her standard after i used it, or when she asked me to make her sister a drink and she went in a mood with me saying i poured to much, or spying on me checking how much bubble bath i use in the bath. She then went cold with me and when i tried to communicate she'd just say she's tired and shes going bed. It eventually got to the point where i could not please her and i was in a dark place lost and confused because we just bought a house and she was being horrible to me, she was once so loving and kind to me (never been one for affection) It's hard especially when you love someone so much like i did her. Here's the awkward part. She can't buy me out of the house because the bank said they won't allow her too, she offered me half of my deposit back saying shes being fair, she's also saying she'll sell the house but asking for wayyy over the asking price knowing it won't sell. She's being so awkward and refusing to communicate with me or give me my key back (i left them there, i know big mistake) she's not taking any pics and sending them me ether so i can use them to give the estate agents. She's aslo seeing a new guy 3 month's after the break up and has him staying there. That's not a big issue because i genuinely want her to move on with anyone so she will wake and and realise that this nightmare needs tl end and we can both move on with our lives. She's going to be so difficult i can see it, this house is her pride and joy shes constantly posting it on social media and inviting friends round for drinks and food while I'm at my mums rotting in depression with zero self esteem.

I've been emailing them regarding the COVID19 situation for the past 2 months and have had a few phone calls asking about cancellation possibilities. We have too many high risk family members declining to attend and that my fiance lost his job during this crisis, so we would feel better holding onto the rest of our wedding budget to prepare for the worst. They would not give us a straight forward answer if June weddings are to be cancelled or not.

The venue is instead offering a new date later in the next year, even after we've said we don't agree with any other dates. They're stating that we lose 100% of the deposit put down if we choose to cancel. Is there any way around this or are we at the mercy of this venue?

Relevant part of the contract below. I'm not trying to screw the venue over - this happened unexpectedly... But we're also not in a position to spend a large amount on an event at the moment.

10. In the event of inclement weather or natural disaster, if the Caterer must cancel this function the terms of Paragraph 6 (a) shall control. However, should the Caterer be prepared in the event of inclement weather or natural disaster to go forward, and it is reasonable prudent to do so, but the Hose cancels, then the damage provision of Paragraph 6(c) shall apply≥ If the Caterer and Hosts mutually agree to move the event to a future date due to circumstances of the inclement weather or natural disaster, than this Agreement will be amended with written consent by the Caterers and the Hosts.

6. CANCELLATION AND REFUNDS — DEPOSITS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AS SET FORTH BELOW  

a. Should the Caterer be unable to perform for reasons beyond his control, Caterer shall be obligated to notify Hosts as soon as reasonably possible and shall return advance deposits. Should this occur, Caterer also agrees to make reasonable efforts to assist the Host in obtaining an alternate location for the event, but in no event is caterer obligated to incur costs in providing such assistance. 

b. Host may cancel the event by written notice to the Caterer within a period of 7 days after this agreement is signed, in which event the deposit will be immediately refunded without charge. However, if the date of this Agreement is less than 14 days before the function, and same is canceled even within 3 days of the signing this Agreement, the caterer may keep the Advanced Deposit as liquidated damages.  

c. If Host cancels the event by written notice to Caterer within a period of 10 days of the event date Caterer will be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of one hundred percent(100%) of all the charges set forth in the Agreement based upon the minimum guarantee which Hosts agree to pay. Such amount shall not be payable if by customary and reasonable efforts the Caterer rebooks the facility for the same period of time for a function of equal or greater value.  

d.

Back on March 25th my employer furloughed all of us due to COVID19 with the intention of bringing everyone back by May 1st, fast forward to April 24th and I was laid off completely with no promise of being brought back (understandable). I asked about what would happen with my PTO (80 hours and \~$1400 worth) and they said ""Virginia law doesn't require that it be paid out"" which is true, however based on my research if it's company policy it should be paid out.

At the time I forgot that in the company handbook that I signed it says: 

&gt;If an employee has unused PTO when their employment ends, the outstanding PTO will be paid out in their final pay check

As far as I know I never signed an updated company handbook and the policy was still the same when I left. So on April 28th I reached out and said:

&gt;Hey &lt;insert name here&gt; I know that Virginia doesn't require paying out PTO upon separation, but I was looking at my employee handbook and noticed that in it the company policy does pay it out upon separation and I was wondering if that was something we could discuss?

I haven't heard anything back and am wondering what my next best steps are to get it paid out. The company is an LLC and is rather small now with the layoffs (under 10 people) but is owned by a larger company.

I am currently renting a longterm AirBNB on a week to week basis in Houston Texas. The Apartment isn't spectacular but it is close to the hospital my Fiance is working at.

EDIT: AirBNB isn't involved because we worked it out off the site for week to week payments. I am just trying to ensure the entire scope is understood

Today the management came to ask us to vacate the property because the lease holder hasn't paid rent. I contacted the lease holder and they told me not to worry about it and that they couldn't kick us out. The management said they would come every day and knock until someone answered to ensure that we hadn't left the property. I can't have them coming to pound obnoxiously on the door and windows every day because she is working nights and it wakes her up. I happened to be in the bathroom when they showed up today and they didn't stop until I was able to make it there. I have made it clear that it isn't my problem to pay the rent to them and that we wouldn't be leaving unless there was an official eviction notice. The person got real bitchy and said okay well I will be back every day to make sure you are still here. I told her I will be here until it is resolved one way or another and that I do not want her to harrass us that way because it disturbs her ability to sleep and explained she is working nights. She said I don't care I will be here every day and it doesn't matter who I wake up. She litterally pounded on the window above my sleeping fiance's head.

1. Should I stop paying rent to the AirBNB manager? (We are not going through AirBNB, we are doing it off the site)
2. Should I find a different place to rent for the next two weeks that we are here?
3. Can I file some sort of harassment charge or something to get them to stop being obnoxious. I can't fix the problem, they know that and they know what the right way to handle the situation is but they are choosing not to.

I'm  currently trying to switch employers from my current  employer to a large defense contractor located in Colorado. Yesterday I tried to provide a two week notice to my employer and they stated that if I were to take this position, I would be in breach of contract.

Their reasoning is that I  have violated the following clause in my employment contract.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3. Non-Solicitation of Customers  
&gt;  
&gt;During the Restricted Period, You shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit any Customer of the  
&gt;  
&gt;Company for the purpose of selling or providing any products or services competitive with the  
&gt;  
&gt;Business. The restrictions set forth in this Section apply only to Customers with whom You had  
&gt;  
&gt;Material Contact during the term of Your employment.

&amp;#x200B;

During my employment with my current company, I worked indirectly for the defense contractor in question \~2 years ago for a period of 6-8 weeks. This contract was obtained by my company as a subcontractor through the company Chef. As I  understand it, the defense contractor contacted Chef to do this work, and Chef subcontracted this work to my employer, who assigned me to do the work.

Because  of this 'material work' that I performed for the defense contractor, they believe I  am in violation of this clause and would be open to legal action if I  were to pursue this position further. I have consulted with my prospective employer and  they recommended I seek independent council, as they believe this would  not hold up and that my company is using this clause to bully me out of accepting a new position.

I've already contacted a few employment attorneys in my area, but I'd like to poll you guys and see what you think before I can get an official answer.

The lease ends June 30th and (best case scenario) we were hoping to go month to month for a while until this whole virus situation calms down or (next best case) move out once our lease was up. 

When I was looking at our lease to see when exactly our move out date was, I noticed that it stipulates that we must give “proper notice” if we don’t plan to renew. The exact wording:

“This lease will AUTOMATICALLY RENEW for a term of one year + 5% rent increase at the ending date of this lease or any renewal term unless proper notice is given. Proper notice requires the Tenant or Landlord to provide written notice of nonrenewal at least 90 days prior to the ending date of this lease or any renewal term.”

,legaladvice,"Hi. So my and boyfriend and I have lived in the same apartment in Albany, NY for two years. Our landlord is not the friendliest landlord but we haven't really had any issues in 2 years. In early March, we developed a mouse problem. Our landlord brought an exterminator out, although we are unsure of her actual exterminating credentials. We didn't ask because we trusted that our landlord was hiring someone legit. But she came in, put some glue traps and poison down and left. The whole process took 15 minutes. Since then, we have had over five mice sightings in two months, and every time it is met with the same response. Send this lady out, she puts some traps and poison down, and leaves. 

Since this is an ongoing issue, we found an extermination company with high reviews and, after seeing a mouse for a 6th time last night, I texted him this morning asking that he use this company instead. I'm not sure if you all need the exact wording of the text, but the jist was ""We don't feel as if the other exterminator is doing enough. We know people who have personally used this company and loved them. Please don't take this the wrong way, but we would really prefer is you call this company as soon as possible to fix this problem."" He responded with ""No way I could take your order on who to use and your command to do it today the wrong way. I will find someone new and schedule an appointment"". We are, frankly, sick of dealing with this problem. We've been really nice about it and it's causing us to feel unsafe in our apartment (the mice not the sassy landlord). 

Here is the issue. We just re-signed the lease on May 1st. We assumed the mouse problem had been taken care of because we hadn't seen a mouse in a couple of weeks. But the new sighting has confirmed that it was not taken care of. There is a clause in the lease that says ""Tenant stipulates, represents and warrants that Tenant has examined the Premises, and that they are at the time of this Lease in good order, repair, and in a safe, clean and tenantable condition."" We would love to break this lease and move at the end of the month, we actually found another apartment down the street from us with a great landlord about an hour ago. But we fear that we don't have any legal grounding to stand on for breaking the lease. But, at the same time, we did see online that NYS has a law that tenants can break a lease if there is a rodent problem that is not being taken care of. 

Additionally, we gave our landlord a signed copy of the lease on April 30th (after having to hound him for a new lease for three weeks). He has not yet returned a copy with his signature on it to us as of today, 5/8/20. Not sure if that matters.

What say you lawyers of Reddit? Would we be able to break the lease even though we signed that the apartment was in livable conditions at the time of signing?

,legaladvice,"Recently, we purchased a used vehicle (Audi) from a smaller dealership/shop, that we had found out of town (70mi) as we have been looking for this particular model and weren't finding many on the market.

Upon arrival the owner informs us of the faults of the vehicle (driver power mirror doesnt move, climate control display has some burn out) and states that they just replaced the intake manifold on it as they tend to have issues with internal valves (keep this part in mind.)

Test drive start, get in and go to start it with keyless start, barely cranked and displayed a battery light. Guys had the car a couple of months so makes sense a battery could be low, but started fine then with key in the ignition. Teat drive goes ok, minor pull but hard to say how the roads are, no real concerns other than a little vibration at stop in gear. Overall we purchase the vehicle.

On drive home, I'm following and I notice that when my girlfriend was changing lanes, her blinker went to right on then left for a couple then right during the lane change. I figured she had bumped it weird or whatever.

Probably the second day of owning it, only driving it about 100 or so miles in total, the battery dies on us at the store. Get a jump to get home and purchased a new battery. We notified the dealership immediately but ultimately I decided it's not a big deal I would prefer a new battery anyways as we had planned on owning the vehicle for a while. The battery was significantly low on electrolyte in one cell. And the seat bolts were rusted down (battery under seat) indicating that the battery itself was not actually inspected.

 During this battery debacle, I had learned that the key for the ignition does not actually go into the mechanism in the door itself.

Back on the road, I noticed that sometimes when you hit the blinker switch to the right, it will flash right once, then go to the left, either fixing itself or mostly staying on left. Only when you lightly press it down, will it fix. This indicates to me a faulty switch internally.

Soon there after, we experienced the wipers come on by themselves, only once, and had the climate control turn on 3 times in a row before it finally stayed off as we had it.

Then suddenly after about 150 or so miles with the new battery, we get a CEL. Pull the code and it is running too lean. Possible vacuum leak. They did replace the intake. I take a look at the intake manifold and notice that the upper housing is adhered with liquid gasket maker, which would not be OEM nor spec as there should be a gasket there.

I have messaged them through facebook messenger only to document our interactions as they have no email listed on their website.

During our conversation I remained professional and left out any personal feelings as much as possible to make the conversation flow. I stated the issues we have been experiencing since the purchase and my concerns with such problems as these were things marked ok or in working order on the window sticker. 

During our conversation it was discovered that the intake assembly was a used unit and states that his mechanic did not inspect the manifold itself because it was a working unit. (How they know I unfortunately didn't ask. )In my opinion, when there is gasket maker where there shouldn't be, you should probably inspect it. I was not happy to learn this information as the condition of that manifold is unknown, mileage, etc. Had the info been given that it was replaced with a used unit, I probably would have declined the sale.

We gave him 3 options. First being a buyback of the vehicle for full price. Second, I would take in for a quote on repairs from an actual certified audi dealership and he would pay for said repairs. Lastly would be legal action. 

He states that he has his policies where he doesnt buy back and doesnt allow others to work on vehicles for him. He is adamant about me bringing him the vehicle so only his shop can repair it, in which, my opinion was not done right the first time and clearly gives me doubts about their ability to actually repair the vehicle properly.

I asked him from our conversation what issues will he be addressing and how will he go about doing so, and will he be offering any short term warranty on the service performed. I have also asked for proof that he can service to audi spec by requesting information on his mechanics certifications in ASE and any other certificates possibly obtained through Audi/Volkswagen making him familiar with their programming in their vehicles. 

I have not heard anything back about the tech. They've offered to come pick it up and service it. Like I said, we don't trust they will be able to since they didn't in the first place. We really just either want our money back or to have it serviced by somewhere that understands Audi's and can give a sense of security behind it.

So with that here are my questions to you guys,

 Do we give them the opportunity to fix it and if it still fails, then go the legal route? What if it fails too far out for any legal action? Do we have to allow him the opportunity to fix it?

 Do we even currently have any leg to stand on when it comes to buyers protections in wisconsin? 

What would be my next steps in legal action? Do I file a complaint with the state? Talk to an attorney? If so, what kind?

Thanks for any help you guys can give.",t2_nb09p,False,,0,False,Bought a problemed vehicle from dealership. Thinking about legal action. Advice? (WI),[],r/legaladvice,False,6,,0,False,t3_gfw566,False,dark,0.4,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588983519.0,text,6,,,text,self.legaladvice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, we purchased a used vehicle (Audi) from a smaller dealership/shop, that we had found out of town (70mi) as we have been looking for this particular model and weren&amp;#39;t finding many on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival the owner informs us of the faults of the vehicle (driver power mirror doesnt move, climate control display has some burn out) and states that they just replaced the intake manifold on it as they tend to have issues with internal valves (keep this part in mind.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test drive start, get in and go to start it with keyless start, barely cranked and displayed a battery light. Guys had the car a couple of months so makes sense a battery could be low, but started fine then with key in the ignition. Teat drive goes ok, minor pull but hard to say how the roads are, no real concerns other than a little vibration at stop in gear. Overall we purchase the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On drive home, I&amp;#39;m following and I notice that when my girlfriend was changing lanes, her blinker went to right on then left for a couple then right during the lane change. I figured she had bumped it weird or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the second day of owning it, only driving it about 100 or so miles in total, the battery dies on us at the store. Get a jump to get home and purchased a new battery. We notified the dealership immediately but ultimately I decided it&amp;#39;s not a big deal I would prefer a new battery anyways as we had planned on owning the vehicle for a while. The battery was significantly low on electrolyte in one cell. And the seat bolts were rusted down (battery under seat) indicating that the battery itself was not actually inspected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this battery debacle, I had learned that the key for the ignition does not actually go into the mechanism in the door itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on the road, I noticed that sometimes when you hit the blinker switch to the right, it will flash right once, then go to the left, either fixing itself or mostly staying on left. Only when you lightly press it down, will it fix. This indicates to me a faulty switch internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon there after, we experienced the wipers come on by themselves, only once, and had the climate control turn on 3 times in a row before it finally stayed off as we had it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then suddenly after about 150 or so miles with the new battery, we get a CEL. Pull the code and it is running too lean. Possible vacuum leak. They did replace the intake. I take a look at the intake manifold and notice that the upper housing is adhered with liquid gasket maker, which would not be OEM nor spec as there should be a gasket there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have messaged them through facebook messenger only to document our interactions as they have no email listed on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our conversation I remained professional and left out any personal feelings as much as possible to make the conversation flow. I stated the issues we have been experiencing since the purchase and my concerns with such problems as these were things marked ok or in working order on the window sticker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our conversation it was discovered that the intake assembly was a used unit and states that his mechanic did not inspect the manifold itself because it was a working unit. (How they know I unfortunately didn&amp;#39;t ask. )In my opinion, when there is gasket maker where there shouldn&amp;#39;t be, you should probably inspect it. I was not happy to learn this information as the condition of that manifold is unknown, mileage, etc. Had the info been given that it was replaced with a used unit, I probably would have declined the sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gave him 3 options. First being a buyback of the vehicle for full price. Second, I would take in for a quote on repairs from an actual certified audi dealership and he would pay for said repairs. Lastly would be legal action. &lt;/p&gt;

Around the time I was born (I was born in 03, we're talking about 04) my parents bought a house. They were married, and both signed off on it. My father had (and continues to have) really shitty credit, so everything was put on my mom. Around 2ish years later, my parents divorced, and during the settlement, the house was split between the two. My mom continued to live in the house with my 3 brothers and myself, paying for it with the 3 jobs she worked to support all of us, while my father moved out and didn't do anything for us or for the home. He's never paid child support, and has openly told me that he never will. What I want to know is if there's any way that legally someone can see that he hasn't lived in the home and hasn't paid anything towards the home, and realize that my mom deserves the home. We're on the verge of losing the home because of economical problems (we bought another home that my stepdad pay's for, my brothers all moved out of the house to live on their own except one, who has to pay for everything except mortgage, etc.) and our only chance of cutting our losses is to sell of the house for a decent price and make whatever we can. The problem is that my father is asking for an ABSURDLY high price (home is worth around 200k because of it's condition, he's asking 280k minimum) and we all know it's because he doesn't give a shit if we lose it or not, he hasn't paid a dime for it. On top of all of this, even if we WERE to sell it off, he would get half of the money, which I see as utter bullshit.

I interviewed and signed an offer with a company for a work from home position. The only thing left to do was a system set up but unfortunately it did not work on my brand new computer for some reason. 
I was supposed to start training next week, but because the system set up failed the HR person told me I need to send an email resigning, that way I could reapply in 6months.

But I quit my old job last month and bought a new computer and some home office supplies because I thought this was a sure thing, so this is hitting me pretty hard.

My partner then said that, the fact that they want me to send an email resigning sounds fishy, he said I might have the right to apply for unemployment, but I don’t know enough about the law to understand this.

TL;DR: We were forced to move out 5 days early so our realtor could walk through the house before she left the country. We didn't get out in time and didn't get to clean because they made us move early, and now our landlord kept our security deposit of $1325,  AND is trying to bill us for an additional $2563.51. we agree among ourselves that we should pay for the water bill, trash service, and two additional days of rent totaling $120.  But she also wants us to replace the toilet, tub, screens (that were never used once - ???), pay the cleaning fee, and labor charges which is insane. Isn't the security deposit supposed to cover any cleaning or replacement costs? The tub and the toilet are normal wear and tear.

Long story:
We were set to move out in early March of this year. My husband told our landlord via phone call back in October 2019 that we would be moving out in the first quarter of 2020. She said to bring it up again when we were ready to move out.

We gave our landlord the date of March 14th, and because of our new landlord wanting us to be in On the date that they did, it was actually only 45-day notice. Our lease states that it requires a 60-day written notice but she told us we didn't need to send a letter. That was our stupidity for listening. But it was via phone call. we don't have it in writing but we have a 40-minute call the day that we came out to view the new house. My husband called her on the drive home to tell her that we would be out by mid-march. 

We told her March 14th because that was the ideal day for us with our work schedules and with moving. Everything was fine, she said she was okay with a notice and agreed to March 14th.

Everything had been done through her realtor, Mary. Well Mary decided to go out of the country during that week and could not be present on March 14th for the final walk-through. Our landlord called us back and told us to move out by March 9th instead. she screamed at my husband and said that he was trying to scam her because he gave 45 day notice instead of 60 day notice. apparently when she called the realtor, the realtor flipped out about the 15-day difference which the landlord had verbally told us was fine.

  at this point we had been busting our asses to get out of the house by the 14th. Moving is expensive and we could not afford movers. We were already extending our moving truck a week longer than we had expected because we only have friends to help us move and we have a lot of stuff that was too valuable to throw out. my husband told her that moving it back to the 9th means that it would be a huge challenge for us and we weren't sure if we could get everything moved and cleaned.

At that point she said we should just work on having the house presentable by the 9th and then we could do the walk-through with the realtor, and then we can work on getting things out afterward. The realtor got back to her and said no, the house needs to be completely moved out of and cleaned before she would do a walk-through. but she could only do it on the 9th, because she was leaving for another country on the 10th.she would not do a walk-through on the 9th unless the house was empty. Well, there was no way without a miracle that the house would be empty on the night so she left for Peru. (She was stuck there in quarantine for weeks, lmfao).

Starting on the 9th my husband had daily phone calls with the landlord updating her on our progress.he told her everything that was still left and what we were still doing. We were working pretty much 8 a.m. to midnight, sometimes until 3 a.m., taking carloads and filling up the moving truck for the 45 minute round-trip to our new house. I had developed a major foot injury and could barely walk. My husband was so exhausted he came home and collapsed into bed every night. We were killing ourselves but we were doing what we had to do.

we had already started our tenancy at the new house March 1st and agreed to stay until the 14th so that we could move. We paid for half a month's rent through the 9th in March at the old house since we were technically still occupying the house. we even offered to pay until the 14th so we could continue to move but she said no, we had to be out by the 9th. We did our best until on the 11th, she called my husband and flipped out that we were breaking tenancy laws, we were squatting, we had to be out by midnight. So we literally grabbed our loads of things and had all of our neighbors take them and hold them in their garages and load up our cars. It was complete chaos for that last day but we got everything out of the house. All the cleaning that we wanted to do didn't get done.

Within 30 days of move out per the lease, we received the list of damages. She is keeping our security deposit.  But she wants to bill us for a bunch of things that are not the old tenant's responsibility. can she legally take us to court over more than $2,000 worth of what she claims are damages?

In 2017 I was working on selling a mid-sized apartment building at roughly $15million.

I secured a buyer and put in an offer but then the owner refused to pay us a fee (I believe because he wanted to ""net"" a certain amount) and neglected to pursue the deal with our buyer. Shortly therafter then went into contract with another buyer but that buyer backed out.

Recently, I found out that he went back to my buyer about a year later, and my buyer did the deal with for a lower price than we had originally procured. Obviously the buyer never had any concern about paying use since we had never discussed it with him due to the fact that seller was expected to pay out commission

I have evidence that I introduced the buyer to the deal, Evidence that I showed him the building, Evidence of assembling all Due diligence items and connecting attorneys to draft to contract,

But no signed commission agreement.

There is a penalty for early termination of this agreement for any reason (10k+), and its something everyone agreed to before starting the job. As of Monday, we are all being furloughed for 12 weeks. We qualify for unemployment, but when asked if we were allowed to find work on our own the response from management was that we could find part time work, but whenever they find us a client to consult for, we are still required by the 27 month contract to quit the work we found and take the consulting gig. My question is if being furloughed has any effect on the binding nature of the 27 month agreement or if we are able to avoid paying the penalty of early termination if I find work myself and want to stick with that full time job.  Currently trying to find the contract to find more explicit language, but this all happened very fast and I am unsure of the implications of any of this. Any advice welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"Hello,

I'm wondering if I have any options here. Obviously right now courts aren't going to be processing something like this, but I'm trying to figure out if there's even anything here worth pursuing.

More than a year ago I listed a property for sale. I live in a different state so I can't really do much to keep an eye on it. While there was considerable interest in the property, there were no offers. Finally the listing expired.

During that time I had heard from another listing agent (the listing changed hands at one point at the agency) that it was possible there was someone squatting there. I called the Sheriff's office to have them go out there but never heard anything back and when I called back some days later no one seemed to know anything.

I just recently listed the home again with another agency. The agent went out and spoke with one of the neighbors, who told him that another neighbor had dumped all kinds of crap onto the property, old appliances, random trash, and had even burned trash on the property. At one point they also apparently dug a deep ditch across the driveway blocking access to the property. They said the neighbor had called the police at one point and they had come out and made them remove the appliances they had dumped over there, and I believe fill in the trench they had dug as well.

They also indicated that these people had spoken to anyone who came out to look at the house and told them it was a meth house and all kinds of other garbage, discouraging people from buying the place.

Almost immediately after listing the property again, I received an offer on it for substantially less than listing price.

I'm wondering if I have any legal recourse here or if it's even something worth pursuing. This is a property in a rural area where even several acres with a home that isn't completely falling down will often sell for under 50k, so I wouldn't really expect damages to be anything spectacular.

Near as I can tell the neighbors who were doing this stuff are not the same as the people who submitted an offer. Interestingly however, the owner of the property where those neighbors live (I've no idea if it's rented out or not) as well as the people who submitted an offer for the property I am selling own a significant amount of property in the area. Near as I can tell they're different people, but between them they probably own at least half the properties in the area.

Curious what you all think I should do. We're selling the property anyway because we want it gone in spite of taking a substantial loss on it because we're a few states away and we never really wanted it to begin with, just kinda ended up with it.

Thanks!

Really hoping someone here can help or point me in the right direction so I can get help.

My girlfriend (non-EU) has been living in the UK (London) for the past 8 years and has been self employed for the past 2/3 years. She has an 8 year old son who was born in the UK and is a resident.

Since the Coronavirus she has been unable to work and therefore unable to pay rent. Today, her landlord gave her notice that she has to move out by August the 3rd.

She has no income to pay rent. She has applied for universal credit but this was denied because her visa has a restriction on receiving public funds. Her appeal was also denied.

She's now applied to have this restriction removed but we have no idea when she'll hear back and if she will be successful. If not, then she could be homeless with her 8 year old son.

Is there anything she can do in her situation? It seems crazy to me that she has paid taxes etc since she's been here but as soon as she's in need, the government won't help.

,legaladvice,"Location: Arizona, Public University(funded by tax dollars) 

I'm going into my third year in college and I've been fighting my university about this for 1 year now. I thought I'd bring it up here in case I can take any legal action against them. Here's the story.

The university I attend was an out of state university when I first enrolled as a freshman. Thus, I paid out of state tuition (nonresident). Of course this makes sense, since my parents pay taxes in a different state, etc. 

But my whole family decided to move with me when I moved for college. They were already planning it, so they settled down in the state of my college around when I started my first year there. They got a job there, bought a house, basically switched everything over to the new state. We figured that the change would be cool to try and hey, after 1 year, I can file for instate tuition since I count as a resident.

This is where things get fishy. After a whole year and my parents filed their taxes in the new state, I decided to file a residency petition at my university.

But I got denied. They said that since my parents moved during the same time I did for college, they said my family moved because I went to college, and therefore didn't qualify.

Obviously, my family got angry because we literally packed up and MOVED everything to the new state. Like EVERYTHING. We live here 100% of the state, sold our old property to buy a new house here... Etc. We've been fighting the university for a year now, and they won't budge. 

Can I take legal action against them?

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going into my third year in college and I&amp;#39;ve been fighting my university about this for 1 year now. I thought I&amp;#39;d bring it up here in case I can take any legal action against them. Here&amp;#39;s the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The university I attend was an out of state university when I first enrolled as a freshman. Thus, I paid out of state tuition (nonresident). Of course this makes sense, since my parents pay taxes in a different state, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my whole family decided to move with me when I moved for college. They were already planning it, so they settled down in the state of my college around when I started my first year there. They got a job there, bought a house, basically switched everything over to the new state. We figured that the change would be cool to try and hey, after 1 year, I can file for instate tuition since I count as a resident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things get fishy. After a whole year and my parents filed their taxes in the new state, I decided to file a residency petition at my university. We provided all our drivers licenses, tax forms, etc. We thought that this would be an easy process: get a approved and done, instate tuition!&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"Hey guys, 

So I'd like a bit of information regarding the UK and what the legal requirements are when learning to drive with a vision impairment. So here are some questions I'd like to know the answer to specifically, I hope someone can help with this.

&amp;#x200B;

* If someone has impaired vision, do they have to inform their driving instructor by law
* Are there any special circumstances where said person isn't required to mention their impairment of vision
* If the person does continue their lessons without informing their instructor can this be used as evidence to attempt insurance fraud
* If a person is required to inform the DVLA of their vision impairment, when are they required to do so (*eg. Prior to lessons, prior to test, prior to insurance claim*)
* In the example of someone being completely blind in one eye, what challenges would they face getting their license, is this an issue or is it possible? Does it need to be mentioned at any of the above mentioned \[points\] of learning?

,legaladvice,"Hi r/legaladvice!

This is a potential situation I am facing, but not sure if I’m in the right area. I’m in the US, state is Pennsylvania. 

Right before covid-19 became what it is today, I took a job with a vet clinic as a receptionist, one perk is that through studying and working with the vets (basically the vet has to watch you/sign off on doing x, y, and z so many times) you can eventually become like a “vet assistant” and can do more and get raises. The vet is only at our location 2x weekly, and I’m only there one of those days (I’m at my other job the other day that we have a vet in house). It’s probably important to note that this is a wellness center. 

Pre-shutdown, I worked a total of two days: my first one was me getting thrown in with the vet (also the day we found out we were getting shutdown since we’re not considered essential), and the next day was actually us closing down our room. We were told that we would get paid for the first two weeks, and would hear from the company weekly after that about money. I have heard from my boss once, and it was just a general check in. Turns out, we are still getting paid, however not at full rate. We’ve been on lockdown for a while now and I am still getting paid.... however, in doing a lot of thinking, I’m realizing I may not want to go back to this job when the world opens back up. Would there be any legal ramifications of taking the money that I’m getting paid now, and then quitting in a couple of weeks? Would I have to return the money or could I get sued for cashing the checks or anything? This is all aside from the moral debate I’m facing, but that’s for a different sub. (Also probably important to note that I have no way of getting my contracts or anything that I signed until we open again, so I’m not sure what was in there that I signed. I wasn’t intending on quitting, job sounded great, but I know myself pretty well and I struggled with the vet who typically comes to us, and I.... I just am not sure this is the right fit for me.

,legaladvice,"Okay so. My close friend (as I thought) Let’s call him Mike - somewhat had an access to my Cashapp account on his phone under my emails and everything. He got his two roommates Linda and Noah  (make-up names) who are living in the same house who are both apparently convicted felons and have served prison/jail time. On my bank statements, Linda’s full name is right there clearly with Mike’s “fake Cashapp name”. When I first saw these statements, I knew something was wrong so I contacted Mike but he denied strongly and even showed his roommates saying they did not know anything about it. He said someone had an access to his account too but couldn’t give the proof of it. This happened last weekend. I have reported to my bank and Cashapp everything but still haven’t received any response from them. It has been a week until now. 

So I did a lot and a lot of self research and discovered many evidences. I went in my google account to check the device histories of my emails where Cashapp was required to sign in for the code. They can’t get the code until they have an access to my emails and they had an access to it on their phones. 
 I saw the registered device and tracked it’s IP address. It matched their location and phone carriers. I have printed all evidences, including the texts between me and Mike. He even got his two friends from other states to “request” and “pay” for him from my account. I have contacted them but one of them only replied saying they did not know. Her credit card was linked to my other email. (There were two Cashapp accounts that were linked to my TWO emails) One was under my name and one was with the made-up username. I have been backing and forth with Mike, with him saying a lot of threats like I’m not welcomed to their house if I thought it was them. Saying that I’m dumbass and stupid. Saying I’m a bad friend for asking around. Telling me that I need to do my homework and all that. BUT that’s what I’ve been doing smh and I even screen recorded our FaceTime conversation which was 19 minutes without him knowing a couple of days. He showed a lot of anger in it and said a lot of OBVIOUS LIES saying that Linda doesn’t have a cashapp account or even a phone. He even said he regularly scams people in the video.

I tried to decline the severance offered in exchange for the 2 weeks from the EH so I can retain the right to bring suit and discuss my experiences with the employer for people in my network who ask. VP-HR said the EH severance requires indemnification. I’m okay with that because I can still lodge a VEVRAA complaint with the DoL, but want to retain the ability to discuss my poor treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"This is in the United States, state is Delaware, but I believe Federal Law applies as it is the WARN Act I am specifically asking about.

I work for a well-known corporation at one of their manufacturing sites. As of the middle of March, the Site employed 298 people. Layoffs were announced and they ended up permanently cutting 65 hourly and 15 salary jobs. These layoffs were completed in April. This past Monday, they announced they would be doing another round of permanent layoffs, which we hear will take place in the next couple of weeks. We do not yet know how many will be affected but the group thought number is probably another 60-75 people. 

My question is: From what I have read about the WARN Act, a mass layoff is defined as an employer of 100 or more persons laying off 33% or greater of those persons. What I haven't seen is if that 33% cut has to be in one fell swoop, or if the cumulative number from several layoffs in relatively close proximity can trigger it, as long as the total cuts equals 33% or greater.

The people that got laid off the first round were paid for two weeks, given four weeks severance, and their health insurance paid for 12 months. My feeling is they company did that to avoid any claims and they probably made the people sign something waiving any future claims in order to get those benefits. I am very close to securing a new job that I will be able to start as soon as I am laid off so I will not need 12 months of health insurance. As the new job will be a fairly significant pay drop, I would much rather have the 60 days pay the WARN Act stipulates must be paid if the company fails to provide 60 days notice.

The other question is if one of the three exceptions to the WARN Act applies. The company, while frequently in the news for its struggles recently, is not is such dire straights that it could reasonably be considered a ""Faltering Company"". I don't think they could successfully argue natural disaster, either. The plant is still operational and we are still making products, albeit at a significantly lower volume.

So my question is this: is there some kind of paperwork or contract I can have written up that makes it so whatever I choose to invest in our joint assets she’d be required to recompense if she left me?

,legaladvice,"I am an Ontario, Canada resident with 2 unpaid speeding tickets and a 3rd that is awaiting a court date in the US.

The first was in Tennessee in 2007.

The second was in New York in 2012.

The third was in West Virginia earlier this year.

While I admit that not paying speeding tickets is stupid, I feel I should mention that I'm not some reckless driver. All of these tickets were relatively small fines for going around 10 - 12 mph over the limit, two of which were in mountainous areas where I just got caught going a little too quick.

After the first ticket in 2007, I was told by someone that US speeding tickets didn't affect insurance back home and that as long as I wasn't pulled over in that same state again it wouldn't matter. I decided to take this chance since I felt avoiding Tennessee would be fairly easy. I did this same thing in New York state while obviously taking some more risk. 

Now I can confirm that these tickets did not affect my drivers rating back home as I have renewed my car insurance several times since the first two tickets and have always had a perfectly clean record.

My question is, do states ever write off unpaid tickets after a period of time? Would it ever be safe again to get pulled over in say Tennessee after 13 years without fear of arrest? Or New York state after 8 years?

,legaladvice,"Sorry in advance but i I am writing this on mobile. I am looking for some help on what my options are. 

I work in TX as an outside salesman selling standby generators for residential homes. I started this position in February with an agreement that I would be compensated $500 a week in base pay plus commissions on whatever i sold.

Now I do want to mention that we were the first group to receive a weekly base pay and the more senior guys work solely off of commissions. Also our benefits did not kick in until 60 days have passed from our start date. My start date was Feb 10 and during the months of March and April we were sent out to homes to conduct appointments during the height of the pandemic. I brought the attention to my superiors that we were not insured at the time and asked if the company was willing to help in any way if were to get sick? We(coworkers included) were asking to just have the 60 days waived so we could sign up to be covered in case you know one of us got sick during a pandemic. Short answer is they said no.

Yesterday my boss comes to me and the three other guys who started at the same time as me and wants to meet with us individually. In the meeting he tells us we are no longer going to get our base pay. He wanted us to sign a new compensation plan right there but none of us did and he said it needed to be signed and returned by this coming Tuesday. Now i questioned him as to why this is happening since we previously had an agreement in place and his.answer was bc of covid. I would like to mention that we were an essential business during the pandemic and never closed down once. It also happens that we had sold more units in March and April than the previous year for those same months so I dont understand how he could put the blame on the pandemic when our numbers were better than lst year non-pademic? I then asked him what would happen if we did not sign? He response was we would part as friends.... I asked him what he meant by that  because it sounded like he was going to fire us if we didnt sign? He continued to use the same line until he finally said if i didnt sign they would fire me.
 We are fighting for the base pay because our job has us  driving our cars too two or three appointments a day with many being on average 30 miles away one way. We do not get anything for gas or to maintain our vehicles. 

 So here i am today looking for help with what I could do as his reasoning in my eyes holds no grounds(i.e. We are an Essential business never closed, better numbers than last year) and it sounds like he is try to use coercion via the pandemic to go back on our previously agreed upon compensation andhave us sign a new one.

,legaladvice,"Location: Pennsylvania

I carried a personally valuable item in my purse for months back and forth on public transport on my commute to school. It disappeared about 3 months ago.  (Presumably, it fell out on my bag, but, under these circumstances, I can't know for sure?)  My name was on it, so I filed multiple missing item requests at the station, at my school, etc., but nothing turned up.

About 6 weeks after losing it, I got a message on Facebook from some man a few towns over that I don't know.  (It's public, has been routinely active from 2011 onward, so I *presume* it's a real one, and matches with someone else's identification).  He told me that he'd found my item on public transport and wanted to return it.  I was delighted and got back to him right away and followed up shortly after with contact info and an offer to pay for the shipping, as well as an offer to meet him somewhere public if that was easier. I also offered a thank you reward for the trouble.  He saw the messages right away (read receipts), but never responded.  

I've been messaging him every ~ 2 weeks with polite reminders asking him to either contact me or mail it, and read receipts tell me that he has seen them, but there has been no response. If he did in fact find it on the public transit, he's been holding it for over 3 months already.

It unsettles me because it's a personal item and therefore feels violating; it includes info from my finances and mental health.  It is also strange to me 1) that it took him 6 weeks to message me in the first place, 2) that he didn't give it to a conductor for Lost &amp; Found and instead took it home...(??), and 3) that he went silent immediately.  It doesn't add up neatly.  

According to PA Title 18, Section 3924, holding on to mislaid or lost property when you have the identifying information of the owner and, with intent to deprive the owner, do not make reasonable efforts to return constitutes theft.  I care less about whether he is actually charged and more about whether I get my stuff back.

I was advised by family members to file a police report.  Is his Facebook profile and his admission to having it enough info for the police to get involved, or won't they bother?  What recourse do I have with the circumstances handed to me?

However, my housemates (two in total) are planning to stay and asked me to sign the lease next year with them because they couldn't find a housemate yet and the lease agreement requires three people. I signed the lease in February because they agreed to be responsible for all rents if they cannot find a housemate. However, one of the housemates now seems to be in some sort of financial difficulty since he has already borrowed $2K from me to pay the rent for the last two months, and I am starting to worry that they might take back what they said and ask me to pay the rent if they cannot find a new housemate especially with what's currently going on with COVID. I know this sounds very stupid of me to sign a lease like this, but they are international students which made me believe they should be doing financially well and paying 50% extra rent not being a problem for them.

Assuming the worst situation where they take back what they agreed on and ask me to pay rents for the next whole year, my question is that what I should do right now to prepare? Am I SOL because I already signed the lease and have no legal documentation of the verbal agreement? I do have text messages where we informally talked about the verbal agreement on they paying the rent, so how heavy does this carry in a legal sense? Should I discuss with them about signing some sort of SOF?

Also, I'm not sure if it matters, but I have been applying to graduate schools since last November. Will this be some sort of proof that will help me show that I have no intention of staying here and therefore makes ""my story"" more believable if we get into a lawsuit?

Early this morning while working as a tow truck driver, I injured my hand while loading a landscaping trailer with a flat tire onto my flatbed. I had to remove some railing on the side of my bed in order to safely load it. Some of the railing was diffucult to remove and in the course of lifting up hard, the rail finally popped out. My hand that was gripping the railing came up into the wheel well of the trailer and hit a sharp edge of metal on the trailer. Long story short i got a pretty nasty cut along with 95% of the fingernail being ripped off. It was very painful. I was wearing work gloves when this happened. I immediately got on the radio and reported my injury. While there was a lot of blood, i could tell there wasnt anything a medical professional could or can do for me. 

After reporting the injury to my dispatcher, i was told by management over the phone to either finish my shift or head to the emergency room. Long story short i told management that i didnt think either option was appropriate.

Last winter, we had a mice issue. We called the property owner and sent in the work order. It was taken care of quickly and we didn't see them again until this January. We called and had them set traps and it was caught. However, shortly after this, more mice were seen running around. We repeated the process. No mice were caught.

,legaladvice,"[Tennessee] former employer (not the one I was laid off from) is appealing my unemployment

I left an employer a year ago, took a new job and unfortunately was laid off due to the current situation. My past employer is now denying my unemployment (not the employer that laid me off)

I left this particular employer because I was constantly being cursed out being called a stupid, bleeping (insert F bomb) bleep (insert a word rhyming with witch) on a daily basis. This went on for 10 months before I couldn’t take it anymore even with the owner of the company sitting there that’s how one employee was allowed to talk to people and the owner did nothing to correct their behavior. 

5 days before I quit the owner of the company shot off fireworks directly behind me while I was outside on my break causing me to lose my hearing in both ears for 24 hours and still having hearing loss in my right ear a year later. I do have doctors documentation of this fact even though I didn’t file for workers comp. In fact when I said it messed up my hearing I was told to toughen up and shake it off.  

The constant stress of always walking on eggshells not wanting to get cussed out was causing me daily migraines, anxiety and depression.  I would literally come home and cry every night. It was taking a tremendous toll on my mental health. I also have an extremely painful autoimmune disease and the stress was causing repeated flares which resulted in significant amounts of pain and inflammation in all of my joints. It was taking a tremendous toll on me mentally, physically and emotionally. 

When I quit I had been screamed at and cursed out 3 times that day. I finally said enough is enough. I packed up my desk, clocked out and walked out. I got in my car and I drove off. I found another job less than a week later so I never filed for unemployment. In fact this is the first time I’ve ever been on unemployment so I’m really confused as to why my former employer was notified of my claim. 

When I was asked on the unemployment application on why I left this said employer I stated I left voluntarily and then they asked the reason and I stated due to working conditions. I felt like it was a very unsafe work place and I had no choice but to leave. It was clear the owner had no control over their employees and didn’t care. It was also clear the owner had no regard for their own actions and no concern when someone loses their sense of hearing due to their negligence. 

I also found out after I quit that in the handbook by failing to give a 2 week notice that I agreed to allow them to withhold my final paycheck which is illegal. I sent a formal demand letter and also called the US Dept of Labor who called them and told them to pay up. I got my final paycheck a week after I quit and 3 days after our regular pay date.  I feel like this should automatically disqualify their appeal because they are in violation of the FSLA and also forcing employees to forfeit their right to employment at will while allowing themselves to remain at will. It feels like indentured servitude not employment at this point. 

How worried do I have to be about this appeal? I feel like I left on grounds that were valid and any reasonable person would not accept the treatment I was receiving and so were other employees.

,legaladvice,"Hello everyone, Advice please USA

Do not want to get fired but fear retaliation don't know what to do. This is currently going on so any advice would be greatly apricated and I'm new here.

My team lead is a very charismatic female that only wants to work with an all male crew, she has said several times she cannot work with other females, guess what gender I am. I've tried throughout the years working with her,  but the side comments, snips, and constant well I'm going to ask so and so continues.

Well last week I had to have a meeting as I had to fix a data file and get things back running per management that has been down a month. Well, since program changes I had to redo much of the work had issues, and did a group meeting as others asked me to. During that meeting I presented much of what issues I had, advised I had to make these changes if you wanted it to work this weekend. No hiding, took a day off and went back to work. By weds email sent out from the team lead to whole team accusing me of sabotage etc., which now affects working relationships.  Previously I have made several complaints of being excluded as always holding things on my day off with her excuse of only time available. Management allows her to get away with this, and she knows how to have other back her up on the team.  I've gone to senior manager but this is still keeping me up at night as she continues to keep digging but in a side manner which many males don't pick up on, so she can get away with it.

What do I do? Should I make it a point on my day off to re-talk to my manager advising that this isn't settle and he needs to do more, as right now she has all the power.  I cannot work for a vindictive person but this isn't the first time a bully was able to get away with things scot free with him.

I need this job to keep my daughter alive, but I don't need to work for people like this or continue to be subjected to this type of environment and allow it to be encourage. She has been this way since she was only temporarily suppose to be in charge but its been years now.

&lt;p&gt;Do not want to get fired but fear retaliation don&amp;#39;t know what to do. This is currently going on so any advice would be greatly apricated and I&amp;#39;m new here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team lead is a very charismatic female that only wants to work with an all male crew, she has said several times she cannot work with other females, guess what gender I am. I&amp;#39;ve tried throughout the years working with her,  but the side comments, snips, and constant well I&amp;#39;m going to ask so and so continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well last week I had to have a meeting as I had to fix a data file and get things back running per management that has been down a month. Well, since program changes I had to redo much of the work had issues, and did a group meeting as others asked me to. During that meeting I presented much of what issues I had, advised I had to make these changes if you wanted it to work this weekend. No hiding, took a day off and went back to work. By weds email sent out from the team lead to whole team accusing me of sabotage etc., which now affects working relationships.

loc: Philippines

I am supposed to move in on the 15th for my review classes in June. However, due to this health crisis, I will not be able to leave my province due to the enhanced community quarantine (the leased space is located in another region next to mine and there is still no assurance when the quarantine ends because of extensions). In addition to this, my review school will be conducting online classes instead (for the first &amp; the mean time) which defeats the purpose of my lease. Since we believe that physical classes will be more effective for me, my parents decided that it is better to take the next schedule of review classes and licensure exam. This confirms that I will no longer need to lease for the said period (May-Nov). 

The company offers six month lease contracts (May-Nov/Nov - May) for reviewers. We are still looking to the possibility that they may allow the application of the deposit and the fee for the next period (Nov-May) although there's a small chance. 

Here are the significant provisions in the contract regarding this: 

The LESSOR shall have the right to forfeit the Security Deposit in the event that the LESSEE unitarillt pre-terminates or abandon this agreement prior to its expiry without prejudice to the other remedies accorded by law to the LESSOR. The Security Deposit shall act as Reservation Fee prior to actual contract date. If in case LESSEE decided not to continue the lease prior to contract date, said security deposit shall be forfeited in favor of the LESSOR. 

In case of back out, pre termination, or forced termination of contract, Lessee agrees that the said admin fee will be forfeited in favor of the LESSOR.

The LESSOR shall not be liable for any injuries or damage caused by any circumstances of force majeure. Force majeure is any event beyond the reasonable control of either party including, but not limited to, war, whether declared or not, rebellion, fire, flooding, and other natural calamities.



I am aware of the contract and have read the clauses properly but I am not sure how it will be applicable in this crisis which we have never encountered in years.

,legaladvice,"Hello all,

Sorry if this is a little long-winded, but I will try to compress everything and only convey the necessary facts. My parents just ended a 3 week long argument over cheating allegations and suspicions my mother has held for some time. She, in the past, received numerous phone calls from several people hinting that he was leading a double life, but she has always chosen to stay. He is emotionally manipulative and has been for as long as I remember. Even now, he keeps bringing up ""fond memories"" of her father, who passed away in June, and all of the things he ""used to"" buy for her, and how they ""used to"" fly business class anywhere. I keep using ""used to"" because for the past 12 years he has done absolutely nothing financially, or otherwise, for our family. A couple of weeks ago, my mum became very cold to my dad, and any time they would talk, it would end in shoutings, denials, and his threatening to leave the country. My mum forgave him two days ago and sent us a text along the lines of ""marriage is hard, please don't be mean to your father."" And my sister and I were just done. Even if the cheating allegations were simply allegations, she had PLENTY to be angry with him for. Over the past few years, we have moved three times, with the last move being to a different state. He had not been there for any of these moves, and everything fell on my sister's shoulders while I was away at college. During that time, my grandfather fell quite ill (Parkinson's) , as did my grandmother (Dementia), so my mum had to make several trips abroad to take care of them, usually accompanied by my sister. All this time, my father was ""working"" in a different country (I put working in quotations because nothing, financially or otherwise, has ever come from this work). My grandfather passed away in June, and despite my mother being heavily upset with my father for not being around/there to offer comfort, she happily jumped back into his arms after he did the bare minimum of helping organize the funeral. All seemed to be going well until the end of April, when this fight happened and was seemingly over. Even after it ended, my father's behavior did not change. He'd order my mum around, make her get him food, despite being literally inches away from the kitchen, and just treating her as the house help. Well, my sister and I were not satisfied with the resolution, because where there there's smoke, there's fire. My sister was able to get into his Whatsapp messages and we now have hundreds of pages of damning screenshots dating back to 2017, when I was getting moved into college, of him texting with this other woman. When I say damning, I mean it is 100% undeniable that he had/is still having (as of March 1 2020, after which he deleted messages) an affair. It was so disgusting. We went through all of the screenshots, highlighted dates and everything. He texted the other woman on all of my parents' anniversary, even the 20th anniversary that he forgot. In 2017, when I was shopping for my dorm, he texted her pictures of us and the things we bought and promised to buy her the same things, even bigger and better. He texted her pictures and videos of the new house my mum built, and she replied with how she wanted to ""visit and meet us."" He texted her during the time my grandfather was ill and my mum had to take time off work to travel abroad to take care of him. He texted her pictures of my sister's graduation and she asked him to congratulate us. My mum, we believe, knew something may have happened, but is completely unaware of to what extent. We plan to present all of the evidence to her tomorrow after she comes back from work. This is where it gets messy and I would like some legal advice. The day after my parents' blow up and the fight ended, my mum put my father's name on the deed to our house as a guarantor. He had brought up during their fight of how he felt like he ""didn't belong"" and that his name wasn't even on the deed (emotional manipulation at it's finest). And I am so angry with her for giving in and doing this, then having the audacity to be angry with us for not forgiving him as well. She has $451k in her 401K, in addition to other stocks and assets, and she also recently bought him a Rolex. He does not work or live in this country, and is just a frequent resident, but his citizenship is to another country. For every financial aid form I've filled out, we only report her income as she has pretty much been a single parent. They were also not married in this country, but my mum is a citizen here and lives/works here. In the case that she decides to divorce, what can be done to ensure this leech does not claim half of her possessions? He has contributed 0% to this house my mum built, our schooling, and anything else of the matter. I'm sure I've left out a lot of important information, so feel free to ask what you need, but any advice at all would be highly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: We are honestly so concerned. We believe this is emotional manipulation of the highest level, and we are quite worried she may decide to stay, and it's just going to take a toll on her. Yesterday, she had to go to the emergency room for high blood pressure and what was thought to be (thankfully not, a heart attack). If she does decide to stay, we are 100% ready and willing to get whoever we need to involved and have her committed, because we truly fear for her health and safety, and she has surrounded herself with people who obviously do not. Anyone who tried to break her out of this, such as my aunt who told her to stand her ground and even secretly made calls to my dad's employees abroad to get their statements, is cut off. We know my mum saw one recent text between my dad and this other woman where he calls her ""my love"" and ""dear"", and he apparently convinced her these were jokes. My mum is not a stupid woman, or at least, I did not thin so before this whole debacle. She is an appraised doctor, but it seems like her love for this man/fear of being alone is keeping her from seeing that he's draining her, financially and emotionally. We have texts showing that heh's been sending this other woman money for as long as they've been together, and buying her lavish gifts. He even put together an entire surprise party for her birthday.

Last year, I signed an agreement with my current company. I'm truly tired of numerous things, including how my bosses have talked to me. I am unsure if I'm able to get out of the contract, because the language is very confusing. 

The last stanza of the agreement says, 

""By signing below, you also indicate your acknowledgement that you shall at all times maintain
confidentiality ofclient names, records, lists etc., and your agreement not to use this information for your
own benefit or the benefit of another person or firm either during your employment or after your

You agree not to solicit business from or provide services to clients on our client list for two years after you departure, whether or not you have worked on those accounts. ""

From what I understand, they are requesting a 30 day notice, but when I asked my boss about this clause before signing, they said, ""[it refers to] after the two years, as we will spend a significant amount of time training you"". Am I being tricked, or am I essentially being enslaved to the company? If so, is that allowed, are there ramifications to trying to break this?

,legaladvice,"TL;DR: I'm writing regarding a Family Law litigation issue in Brazil, It's a complex case involving long term mistreatment, Affective/Material Abandonment, and constant abuse of a mentally disabled youth. Looking for serious advice on how to get off this situation and where to seek real help.

Although we are going through a period of contingency and quarantine due to this unexpected COVID-19 pandemic. But once the routine normalizes on a larger scale, it would ask for legal assistance with a deal that should have been in progress since at least 2008. I'll ask that due legal process be done in view of an injunction of this urgent request.

I'm intending to plead, due to affective and material persistent abandonment and if possible: in order to investigate his incomes, the breach of secrecy of his tax revenue of the last 4 years and respective payslips, including from his businesses. Due to misdemeanors motivated by religious fundamentalist sect engagement. Judicial decision for the father to undergo psychiatric expertise and possible therapeutic referral to the conditions: TOD - Opposing Challenge Disorder (CID F91.3) and dissocial personality disorder (CID F60. 2). if possible: change of family for late adoption to another with the same socioeconomic conditions in order to maintain studies in higher education and maintain specialized medical treatment for my mental condition and other physical conditions until I acquire experience to work. and if accepted: later suspension of family power of origin so that instead of compensation for moral and psychological damage, I am in fact placed in a family so that I have support in addition to financial and emotional stable in the long term. There is a very strong aspect involving psychological violence and emotional abuse that prevails in my case. If it is to be classified as an infraction, misdemeanor or crime, as it will be dealt with by the courts, its various implications to be reflected in the sentence, I would prefer that pecuniary and socio educational measures be taken in the foreground.

I am 27 years old, I do specialized health treatment, including psychiatric. I'm diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder depressive type (CID F25. 1) and ADHD. I'm on treatment for at least 10 years. I have lived in countryside in Brazil for two years. My father, who provides for me, is a cardiologist physician. But we still have constant friction for a long time monetary reason.

Here is my account of some of the facts that persisted during the mistreatment suffered in living with my family of origin:

During early childhood until mid adolescence I suffered physical punishment and isolation for hours on end. I suffered malnutrition, depression and child stress since before the age of 6 due to the absence of my father, and even with his relative presence of a few minutes a day at a later time, I had social and material deprivation from him and from my biological mother. During the time I lived with my progenitor, I was the object of constant psychological games and terror besides her and his moral harassment. Together, my immediate family kept my friends and other people away from me with rumors and defamation of these friends and their parents. My parent not only denied the period in which I was punctually sexually molested and constantly emotionally abused by my biological mother, but also inflicted on me discrimination and isolation because of the first signs of my affective orientation being homosexual, as well as intimidation and overcharging for independence without the necessary financial and emotional support in the pre-adolescent period.

I was abandoned in a fundamentalist evangelical school on a reformatory like regiment with sporadic monthly visits from family, already at the age of 11 when I suffered enticement and collective rape in the dormitory by 3 other adolescent boys for at least 1 year. Leaving there, I was forced to move from a city with no health care structure and not say goodbye to colleagues and friends for at least 6 consecutive times. I suffered harassment and bullying in some schools and missed the last year of high school by a nervous breakdown. I was abandoned in long-term psychiatric clinics with divergent treatments to my health condition and spent years without clinical improvement. My various health problems were neglected over the years until I recently sought health insurance on my own initiative. I am still the object of constant humiliation and subjugation on the pretext of having tried marijuana even though I no longer have contact or use during those years (since at least 2013). Even though I have been taking treatments and trying to cure my difficulties, he denies my situation and according to him my attitude is bad will and lack of shame.

I suffered insidious discrimination through punitive treatment because I was born a man. Mainly as a man who does not act according to the ideal of dominant male gender role tied to the idea that there is usually a natural role and social forms of behavior for men due to the social stigma in relation to my lack of masculine aggressiveness, disparaging my notion of masculinity.

Domestic violence with regard to controlling, coercive and threatening behavior. The mistreatment of those entrusted to my care and guidance. Any behavior interpreted as inappropriate for any family member and which could lead them to believe that such behavior was considered unacceptable, was seen as a direct challenge to their intended authority. This repetitive and humiliating treatment, which threatens, intimidates, frightens, continually criticizes, devalues efforts in private or even public, and exercises emotional manipulation.

Emotional abuse involving nullifying or demoralizing the feeling of self-esteem and autonomy. Psychological violence based on my gender, resulting in serious harm and suffering through threats, coercion, arbitrary deprivation of liberty, negatively impacting my identity, well-being and dignity. Including violence abuse through verbal and non-verbal language, bullying, stalking, homophobia.

Under a facade that imputes incomprehension as socially accepted violence in this country, through which the prevailing view of the social sphere is legitimized. Being hidden in every action and denied in practice by the observable form of the act. I do not know if it was consciously done in an architectural or rational way. It was a kind of symbolic violence that worked through complicity between the practitioners of the immediate family and their peers, either in their willingness to dominate or a certain willingness to submit on my part.

This covert form of violence was a way of exercising dominance and exploitation over my psychological. Consisting of a dynamic in nuance, easier to apply because it is less susceptible to reproach. Just as the accumulation of power over the other is legitimated by active denial and concealment in subtle signs recognized as legitimate requests for change to behavior that would be accepted by these aggressors.

The financial abuse that occurred was about controlling my access to the family's economic resources in addition to social deprivation in order to reduce or prevent the culturally normal interaction between an individual and the rest of secular society. Consequently, it diminished my ability to support myself, increasing my dependence on the aggressor. My aggressor has made me financially dependent for an indefinite period of time, including reduced access to better education, employment, career advancement, and the acquisition of assets. Even forcing or pressing me to sign documents to open accounts and use checks for his own use and benefit.

My livelihood was placed in a closely monitored grant, avoiding any expense without the consent of the aggressor, leading to **minute accumulation of debt and depletion of any savings. Disagreements over money spent could result in retaliation for additional physical or emotional abuse.**

He is financially able to provide for my needs such as clothing and furniture, but constantly defers expenses other than college tuition, housing, food and medicine. Today I live by myself, have decent housing, minimal food, and medical treatment provided by my constant insistence on sacrificing clothing and furniture. He makes use of psychological games and constant emotional blackmail to diminish these insistence. Today even my first order needs are treated with contempt and constant postponement until their nullity or status-quo. My expenses are taxed as 'stewardship' or 'expense' and he justifies by saying that since he has never had access to such support, even showing conditions to provide, he alters himself and threatens me by saying that this is none of my business and acts with avoidance and rejection of any change to the situation that might favor me. He also avoids issues related to any change in the budget, says that I need to save money (which is not being enough for all the treatments and food needed). I proposed several times to live on a major city here in Brazil so that I could take a shorter professional course and start working but he insists that he would not support me if he left where I am. He makes threats, pressure and blackmail so I won't seek help or leave what he dictates. While any opportunity for financial and social autonomy ever offered was constantly sabotaged at that time.

Due to problems with work justice, my father coerced me into opening bank accounts and signing sales documents for another of his cars. He still uses bank accounts in my name and doesn't give me access to the money in them. Lately my father hangs up his cell phone and does not answer my calls during the week. When I finally **get in touch, he doesn't talk to me for more than 10 minutes on the phone.** When he visits me, sometimes once a month in the city where I live, and when I mention any kind of reconciliation or long-term involvement in trying to appease this conflict, he implies that he now has another family and that I will probably have no inheritance. Concerned about keeping up appearances, my parents preferred to lead a way of life that collaterally impaired my psychological and professional structuring rather than ask for an abortion or even adoption at an appropriate age.

I am a transwoman currently in her last year of college. Over the past few months I have been doing what I needed to do in order to get my name changed. I notified the school and have been attempting to meet their criteria to change my name.

I notified my school back in Feburary about the change so that they could change the name on the commencement, however, even though they claimed the name was changed I am not on the commencement currently.

Furthermore, due to the SS office being closed I was unable to change my name in their system. I sent a copy of the legal document to my school to let them know about the name change but they refused to change it until I got my social security card updated.

Finally, due to the virus we are doing an online commencement. I was not notified by email about this and only managed to find out due to a friend who sent me the website for the marching order. I tried to sign up on that website, but I was told that my account does not have a graduation. I tried emailing graduation at the school but they have not answered my emails.

&lt;p&gt;I am a transwoman currently in her last year of college. Over the past few months I have been doing what I needed to do in order to get my name changed. I notified the school and have been attempting to meet their criteria to change my name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I notified my school back in Feburary about the change so that they could change the name on the commencement, however, even though they claimed the name was changed I am not on the commencement currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, due to the SS office being closed I was unable to change my name in their system. I sent a copy of the legal document to my school to let them know about the name change but they refused to change it until I got my social security card updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, due to the virus we are doing an online commencement. I was not notified by email about this and only managed to find out due to a friend who sent me the website for the marching order. I tried to sign up on that website, but I was told that my account does not have a graduation. I tried emailing graduation at the school but they have not answered my emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am at a loss for what to do currently. I&amp;#39;ve already had troubles with the school in the past due to their handling of trans related issues. But I am honestly beyond pissed at this current string of events.&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"Hi, I hope this isn't a repeat of a previous/similar post. If so, I apologize.

I'm an American living in Mexico, and before COVID-19 hit I was in the process of getting my work visa. My contract states that my place of work will cover all visa-related costs, and my visa was approved on February 21. I was supposed to go to the US and meet with the consulate to finalize the process by April 7. I had an appointment and plans to go in early April, but by that time, travel was restricted and I was unable to leave Mexico safely. Since that time, I've been laid off from my job and I'm unsure if I'll be getting it back or not.

Now, I am starting a new part-time job (still in Mexico) but I still would like to finalize my Visa process. As all costs of obtaining this Visa (a lawyer, all documentation, plane tickets, etc) were paid by my previous place of work, what rights do I have in finalizing that process now that I have been let go? My employment contract includes full coverage of those costs, but my contract was also supposed to last a year. Since my contract was terminated early (though due to no fault of my own) I'm not sure if my contractual rights pertaining to the visa still apply. Plus, they've already spent the money to cover all the costs of my visa, so not following through would be a loss to them, as well as to me if I have to start over again.

TL;DR - Can I still finalize my work visa sponsored by a company I no longer work for? Or do I need to start the entire visa process from the ground-up? Also, due to COVID-19, will the consulate honor my paperwork even though I was supposed to have had my appointment with them by April 7?

We had a method; I use a barcode at self check out that’s only worth .89 and pretend to scan most of the items while the friend distracts the cashier by either talking to them or they’d buy alcohol. We had moments where we felt it was a close call with certain comments directed towards us that we thought we were overthinking and we sometimes heard associates communication on the walkie-talkies throughout this entire time. Thinking back I believe it wasn’t coincidence and that it’s definitely been because they’ve been confirming and building a case against us. I know that some retail stores will let you keep getting away until they know you’ve reached an amount that could land you a felony charge. It wasn’t until recently that the comments became more aggressively direct from the associates. We were doing the normal check out thing and I noticed LP with the grey shirt standing and he clearly stated he has his eyes on me into his mic.

,legaladvice,"So, long story short, but gets longer. my fiance ended up getting a bacterial infection. The doctors were leaning towards a tick bite since I had pull one off of her shortly to her getting sick. Let me be clear. My fiance is an IV drug user. She was prescribed far too much pain medicine for far to long for a back injury, and ended up dependant on the medication. She voluntary stopped going to the doctor herself, and started trying to ween herself off.

Come now. She started getting very I'll, and very dehydrated as she wouldn't drink or eat. We went to an urgent care and the doctor there was informed she was an IV drug user and the doctor said I don't believe this is relevant, I believe we're more leaning towards the bug bite turning to staph, or maybe a tick borne illness which we won't know till we get the tick panel back. 

Well things just went downhill from there. Her labs came back with low kidney function and so the urgent care doc said she needed the ER. She has been very uncomfortable since she has been in there, obviously since they're not giving her the same dosage as she is used to to maintain, but but even when maintaining at home, she was in the same amount of pain. 

Cue tonight. All the nurses have been very friendly and have answered my questions with patience. I happened to be on the phone with my fiance when her nurse walked in, and I was trying to calm her down cause she was breathing to quickly, and they're thinking the bacteria caused a bit of pnuemonia.

While I was on my fiance's cell phone she had me on speaker phone, and the nurse walked in to change her fluids, and I was calming her down and trying to comfort her, and all of a sudden the nurse says hey let me talk to whoever that is and takes the phone and says

 ""I'm gonna be honest with you. She's a junkie and she's coming off dope.. that is why she is so uncomfortable. She failed her drug test for benzos and opiates, (both things that were prescribed to her up until a couple months ago when she stopped going to the doctor during this covid thing, although not the ROA that she chose) and she's in withdrawals. That's why she is so uncomfortable. And I'm telling you this because my husband died of it, and I'm 5 years sober myself. I was a nurse that got caught and had to go through a 2 year drug court/probation period. So she is going through hell right now, but she brought this all on herself.. this infection is more than likely a result of her drug use  (which I was not told at anytime even though the doctors were aware of her being an IV user, they were leaning towards the tick, or the tick bite allowing something in, and EVEN IF IT WAS I don't believe that's relevant to her immediate treatment""

She continued "" she's a junkie and she's going through hell right now coming off her dope and that's why she's going through so much pain, and so I don't feel bad for her, I've been there and I got through it on my own, but she did this to herself by shooting up whatever she could get in front of her and she is really sick and is lucky to be alive. So you can try to calm her down all you want but she's a junkie she's detoxing and this is the best thing for her is her to just lay here and get it out of her system. I'm not compassionate to other drugs users and she's lucky she got a doctor that is that is actually giving her Ativan and 2mg of morphine cause if it were me, I wouldn't have. She's  a junkie so the best thing you can do is leave her here to detox and get this stuff out of her system cause she clearly uses a lot and she just wants to get high so she's lucky to be alive but I'm not gonna be rainbows and Sunshine's to her because i dont feel bad for her cause she is just a drug addict."" 

So I said wow well can you put her back on the phone please, and my fiance was hysterical and felt degraded and what that nurse did was inhumane in the condition that she is in right now.. the nurse said ""they did an echo to look for endocarditis and didnt see any, but she said so they wanna do a TEE and echo the back of the heart to look for vegetations, and if that's the case than she will be in the hospital for 3-6 months and nobody will see her because of the visitor policy and and it won't be anyone's fault but this girl right here. She has a bad problem and all the pain is from the drugs so I don't feel for her""

I told her even when she was using, the pain was still this bad and she was making the same moans and groans before she even came to ER and got admitted, and she had used during all the days prior and was still in this amount of pain because she has abscesses inside of her hip that are not external, right under the tick bit.

I feel like this was totally uncalled for, first off, I called my fiance to talk to HER. I DIDNT call the nurse to talk to her, I just happened to call my fiance's PERSONAL CELL PHONE and when the nurse came in to change her fluids she just jumped in our conversation and started berating my fiance TO ME and embarrassing the SHIT out of her to me without even knowing who it was that she had on my fiance's phone .. I didn't provide a privacy code, and have never talked to this nurse before so it's not like she knew who I was, and she just started rattling off to me EVERYTHING ABOUT MY FIANCE andbhabout how her husband OD'd and she was a junkie to and so when she sees people like this she doesnt try to comfort them because she knows what she was like when she was a junkie. Then starts telling me her brother came back from Afghanistan and is shooting heroin in his neck blah blah....

Long story short, my girlfriend is in really bad shape with this infection, NO MATTER WHAT THE REASON IS I don't believe ANY of that was necessary for several reasons.

1. She has no idea who she was telling about my fiance's PERSONAL life and medical situation. I didn't introduce myself, I simply called my fiance to talk and this girl takes the phone and says go head and close your eyes if you want to rest, I'll talk to him. 

2. My fiance has never denied her drug use during her hospital visit, she has track marks for gods sake and has been honest about everything she uses. And NO ONE has treated her like that, MOST have actually given her info on how to get help, where to go for a needle exchange, and how to try to be as clean as possible. This nurse BERATED AND PHYSICALLY abused and humiliated my fiance to whoever she thought was on the other line, (thank God it was me) and especially with this no visitor policy, she is going through all this by herself and is very confused because of the dehydration, and infection. 

3. Is this anywhere near acceptable? My fiance was hysterical in the background, and it all started because she asked if it was time for her medicine yet, and the nurse went on a rampage about how no its not, you only want it cause you're an addict and that's not happening you'll get it as needed and that's when she got on the phone with me and said I'm gonna be honest with you, blah blah blah.

This was devastating as my fiance is already confused and isn't 100% there during all of this whether it be from the withdrawals or from the infection, but for this nurse to just DOG her and humilitate her RIGHT in front of her face while she is already in VERY BAD CONDITION, to whoever happened to be on the other side of that phone (THANK GOD it happened to be me and not someone else) without asking for a privacy code, without asking who I was, just rattling off all her personal business and deameaning the FUCK out of her all while she lay hysterical in the background. 

Is there anything I can do? She can do? I don't want this nurse ANYWHERE near my fiance EVER again, and i also believe she violated her patient confidentially and violated her basic human rights to be treated humane like a decent human being especially while she lay there ALONE scared and VERY sick BESIDES the withdrawals which is the least of it because she was sick even in the days before WHILE using. 

Please.. someone help me.. I'm so hurt for her. I get it. But I don't believe this nurse who knows nothing about her personal situation, had the right to do what she did, and I also believe there has to be something that can be done.  She was so embarrassed, and scared and hysterical in the background while this nurse dogged her to me on MY FIANCES CELL PHONE!!!!!! I literally am fuming. Please help give me some guidance here whether this was just a shitty human being, or whether she was out of line and/or violated any of my fiance's rights as a human AND AS A PATIENT. AT THE LEAST I don't ever want that nurse in that room again. Ever. But I feel this goes further. 

Sorry for the long read, but I'm fuming right now. I'm literally FUMING. Please help. 

Sorry to if it was a ramble, this has all be very hard, and this did not make it better for anyone for a nurse to make my fiance feel like a giant piece of shit while she is grasping for her life trying to recover.

EDIT: IN CASE IT WASNT MADE CLEAR. SHE HAS AN INTERNAL ABSCESS UNDERNEATH A KNOWN TICK BITE LOCATION ON HER REAR PELVIC. 

Why is it all you ""recovered addicts"" want to be holier than thou all of a sudden? I'm sure you weren't that way when you were dependant on your drug of choice? Here's the problem let's get it clear. If you don't want to take care of people, whether it be drug addicts, obesity, mental illness, etc... don't become a nurse. Cause that half broken pedestal your preaching from is broken. ANYONE can become an addict with the right injury and the wrong doctor. ANYONE. IF YOU WANT TO JUDGE PEOPLE AND PREY ON THE WEAK, AND Maybe just maybe, if you  DON'T WANNA TREAT DRUG ADDICTS DONT WORK IN A HOSPITAL",t2_eeowt,False,,0,False,Nurse just berated and embarrassed my fiance who is in critical condition.

The doctors were leaning towards a tick bite since I had pull one off of her shortly to her getting sick. Let me be clear. My fiance is an IV drug user. She was prescribed far too much pain medicine for far to long for a back injury, and ended up dependant on the medication. She voluntary stopped going to the doctor herself, and started trying to ween herself off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come now. She started getting very I&amp;#39;ll, and very dehydrated as she wouldn&amp;#39;t drink or eat. We went to an urgent care and the doctor there was informed she was an IV drug user and the doctor said I don&amp;#39;t believe this is relevant, I believe we&amp;#39;re more leaning towards the bug bite turning to staph, or maybe a tick borne illness which we won&amp;#39;t know till we get the tick panel back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well things just went downhill from there. Her labs came back with low kidney function and so the urgent care doc said she needed the ER. She has been very uncomfortable since she has been in there, obviously since they&amp;#39;re not giving her the same dosage as she is used to to maintain, but but even when maintaining at home, she was in the same amount of pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cue tonight. All the nurses have been very friendly and have answered my questions with patience. I happened to be on the phone with my fiance when her nurse walked in, and I was trying to calm her down cause she was breathing to quickly, and they&amp;#39;re thinking the bacteria caused a bit of pnuemonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was on my fiance&amp;#39;s cell phone she had me on speaker phone, and the nurse walked in to change her fluids, and I was calming her down and trying to comfort her, and all of a sudden the nurse says hey let me talk to whoever that is and takes the phone and says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna be honest with you. She&amp;#39;s a junkie and she&amp;#39;s coming off dope.. that is why she is so uncomfortable. She failed her drug test for benzos and opiates, (both things that were prescribed to her up until a couple months ago when she stopped going to the doctor during this covid thing, although not the ROA that she chose) and she&amp;#39;s in withdrawals. That&amp;#39;s why she is so uncomfortable. And I&amp;#39;m telling you this because my husband died of it, and I&amp;#39;m 5 years sober myself. I was a nurse that got caught and had to go through a 2 year drug court/probation period. So she is going through hell right now, but she brought this all on herself.. this infection is more than likely a result of her drug use  (which I was not told at anytime even though the doctors were aware of her being an IV user, they were leaning towards the tick, or the tick bite allowing something in, and EVEN IF IT WAS I don&amp;#39;t believe that&amp;#39;s relevant to her immediate treatment&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She continued &amp;quot; she&amp;#39;s a junkie and she&amp;#39;s going through hell right now coming off her dope and that&amp;#39;s why she&amp;#39;s going through so much pain, and so I don&amp;#39;t feel bad for her, I&amp;#39;ve been there and I got through it on my own, but she did this to herself by shooting up whatever she could get in front of her and she is really sick and is lucky to be alive. So you can try to calm her down all you want but she&amp;#39;s a junkie she&amp;#39;s detoxing and this is the best thing for her is her to just lay here and get it out of her system. I&amp;#39;m not compassionate to other drugs users and she&amp;#39;s lucky she got a doctor that is that is actually giving her Ativan and 2mg of morphine cause if it were me, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have. She&amp;#39;s  a junkie so the best thing you can do is leave her here to detox and get this stuff out of her system cause she clearly uses a lot and she just wants to get high so she&amp;#39;s lucky to be alive but I&amp;#39;m not gonna be rainbows and Sunshine&amp;#39;s to her because i dont feel bad for her cause she is just a drug addict.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I said wow well can you put her back on the phone please, and my fiance was hysterical and felt degraded and what that nurse did was inhumane in the condition that she is in right now.. the nurse said &amp;quot;they did an echo to look for endocarditis and didnt see any, but she said so they wanna do a TEE and echo the back of the heart to look for vegetations, and if that&amp;#39;s the case than she will be in the hospital for 3-6 months and nobody will see her because of the visitor policy and and it won&amp;#39;t be anyone&amp;#39;s fault but this girl right here. She has a bad problem and all the pain is from the drugs so I don&amp;#39;t feel for her&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her even when she was using, the pain was still this bad and she was making the same moans and groans before she even came to ER and got admitted, and she had used during all the days prior and was still in this amount of pain because she has abscesses inside of her hip that are not external, right under the tick bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like this was totally uncalled for, first off, I called my fiance to talk to HER. I DIDNT call the nurse to talk to her, I just happened to call my fiance&amp;#39;s PERSONAL CELL PHONE and when the nurse came in to change her fluids she just jumped in our conversation and started berating my fiance TO ME and embarrassing the SHIT out of her to me without even knowing who it was that she had on my fiance&amp;#39;s phone .. I didn&amp;#39;t provide a privacy code, and have never talked to this nurse before so it&amp;#39;s not like she knew who I was, and she just started rattling off to me EVERYTHING ABOUT MY FIANCE andbhabout how her husband OD&amp;#39;d and she was a junkie to and so when she sees people like this she doesnt try to comfort them because she knows what she was like when she was a junkie. Then starts telling me her brother came back from Afghanistan and is shooting heroin in his neck blah blah....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, my girlfriend is in really bad shape with this infection, NO MATTER WHAT THE REASON IS I don&amp;#39;t believe ANY of that was necessary for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has no idea who she was telling about my fiance&amp;#39;s PERSONAL life and medical situation. I didn&amp;#39;t introduce myself, I simply called my fiance to talk and this girl takes the phone and says go head and close your eyes if you want to rest, I&amp;#39;ll talk to him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My fiance has never denied her drug use during her hospital visit, she has track marks for gods sake and has been honest about everything she uses. And NO ONE has treated her like that, MOST have actually given her info on how to get help, where to go for a needle exchange, and how to try to be as clean as possible. This nurse BERATED AND PHYSICALLY abused and humiliated my fiance to whoever she thought was on the other line, (thank God it was me) and especially with this no visitor policy, she is going through all this by herself and is very confused because of the dehydration, and infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this anywhere near acceptable? My fiance was hysterical in the background, and it all started because she asked if it was time for her medicine yet, and the nurse went on a rampage about how no its not, you only want it cause you&amp;#39;re an addict and that&amp;#39;s not happening you&amp;#39;ll get it as needed and that&amp;#39;s when she got on the phone with me and said I&amp;#39;m gonna be honest with you, blah blah blah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I park on a first come first serve parking lot. I last drove my car on Monday. I discovered that my car was towed on Thursday. The actual towing happening on Wednesday. Management, sometime between Monday and Wednesday put up signs that declared no parking. About the same time, put two conflicting notices in my mailbox which I did not discover until Thursday. It said no parking Wednesday. The other notice said no parking Thursday. To add to the confusion, with words they said no parking on N side of the lot, with a Map, they circled the south Lot. A neighbor took a picture of the sign in the S. of the lot that said Wednesday.

I transferred from one apartment to another in the same complex. Parking is limited to one per residence. I have a parking permit sticker on my dash that was applied and given at my previous apartment with an expiration date of 2021. When I went to the tow yard, I have discovered that the tow was authorized by the maintenance supervisor. Who listed the reason for the tow was ""Permit did not correspond to unit"" He went to my previous residence looking for me (I assume he didn’t have access to my file, but did have access to the parking permit file). They did not call me. On my lease, the following is the only thing mention about parking,   
 

*“Only vehicles with currently valid parking permits issued by X may park in lots located within the X Development. If parking spaces are assigned, Resident shall only park in their assigned space.”*

So my questions are,

1. Did I have a valid permit if it was issued during the previous residence?

2. Does it matter that I renewed my lease 2 months ago, and on the lease it listed the permit number that was given during my previous residence?  Does this make it valid?

3. Did I have a lease, license or easement to the parking space?

4. How much notice am I entitled to? Can they modify the agreement with 1 or 2 days notice? And did they have a duty to ensure that I received the notice? Does it matter that I did not get the notice until Thursday? Does it matter that they went to the wrong apartment to give notice in person?

5. If the parking space was leased to me, did the towing of my car require an eviction remedy therefore causing this to be a wrongful eviction?

6. If my permit was a license, was my parking permit suspended without me having received notice, and is that valid?

7. Do I have a case and what cause(s) of action can you think of? Trespass to chattels, wrongful eviction?",t2_675awa83,False,,0,False,"Is parking spaces leased, licensed?

Here is a list of facts and things that has been happening:

* Living in an apartment with 3 others (so 4 total).
* One or more might be immunocompromised, and cannot risk getting COVID-19.
* All other roommates have been following the stay-at-home order, except for the perpetrator (calling him P from now on).
* When asked not to bring any guests during this quarantine, P agreed (verbally, not written).
* P brought a guest over claiming that the guest has been in quarantine for 2 weeks.
* P asked if they can go back to the guest's apartment for some reason to which we agreed, but P instead went to someone else's place to have a party/group gathering (we know this because we saw P's location on an app).
* P lied to the rest of us and told us they only went to the guest's apartment and back.
* Did not admit about this until we told P about seeing the location.
* P's family member (who P has been in contact with) is a nurse. This person has not been tested yet.

Because of this, the 3 of us (including me) want to leave this place. However, we are not in a good place in terms of money as well (we're all college students).

Turns out I had initialed a section in the contract where I acknowledge that in order to set a termination date at August 27th, 2020, I needed to have submitted an ""N9 Tenant's Notice to End the Tenancy"" form by January 15th, 2020.

,legaladvice,"In a felony case, the police are required by law to obtain a special authorization prior to doing a wiretap, or the wiretap is inadmissible in court. Their evidence includes wiretaps. The discovery includes reference numbers to the authorization for each wiretap. It also includes copies of the authorization forms for each wiretap, except for one. This is odd because (a) the prosecutor's case largely depends on this wiretap and (b) only its authorization is missing. So, most likely, the prosecutor forgot to include a copy of its authorization in the discovery. 

But, what if the prosecutor/police forgot to get the authorization prior to the wiretap?

How would someone find out whether that missing authorization form exists and, if so, whether it was created prior to the wiretap? It's reference number is known so looking it up shouldn't be hard. But asking the prosecutor for it directly may end up tipping them off that they've got a loose thread.

Their evidence includes wiretaps. The discovery includes reference numbers to the authorization for each wiretap. It also includes copies of the authorization forms for each wiretap, except for one. This is odd because (a) the prosecutor&amp;#39;s case largely depends on this wiretap and (b) only its authorization is missing. So, most likely, the prosecutor forgot to include a copy of its authorization in the discovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, what if the prosecutor/police forgot to get the authorization prior to the wiretap?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would someone find out whether that missing authorization form exists and, if so, whether it was created prior to the wiretap? It&amp;#39;s reference number is known so looking it up shouldn&amp;#39;t be hard. But asking the prosecutor for it directly may end up tipping them off that they&amp;#39;ve got a loose thread. At risk of being paranoid, could the prosecutor/detective could create a backdated version of the authorization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawyer is an overwhelmed public defender. They can&amp;#39;t be counted on to do investigative work.&lt;/p&gt;

I find the non-emergency police number in my phone and dial it. we've had the police out before for odd random incidences. So she keeps telling and getting louder, she was yelling at some man, I'm not sure if they were together.

They tried to come in the store, the lady yelled at me to call the cops, I told her they were already on the phone. She immediately knocked over a stack of baskets and a product display right next to the door. I yelled ""that's it, get out, we're closed""

at first I thought they were having some type of argument about a relationship but the guy got in his car and drove away and the girl just sat down on the sidewalk. At this point the police dispatcher had told me that police were on their way. Things settled down for a few minutes. Another customer came into the store and as I was milling around they told me she was throwing rocks at our company cars. 

I started videoing with my phone. She was throwing rocks from the parking lot at our company cars. Then she turned and started walking toward my car. I kept filming. She threw a rock straight at my car and it broke the little triangle window behind my driver door. At that point I flipped, I went out side and screamed in my deepest voice for her to stop and leave, she leaves the parking lot. I see her walk into the drugstore across the parking lot. 

At this point, I am on the phone with 911, a couple minutes have passed since she went into the drugstore and a hand full of people come running out. She caused some terrible ruckus in the drug store, the police arrived shortly after and arrested her.

The police took my name and info and a statement, he gave me a card with his email and I sent him the pictures of the damage to my car and the video of the woman damaging the cars, I have not received an answer yet but this all happened earlier this evening.

This is the first car I've ever had a payment and full coverage on, I think they might cover the damage but I'm pretty sure my rates would go up and I don't want that. I'm angry as hell about the car but the thing that pisses me off more is the idea of paying higher premiums for something SHE did to ME absent ANY control I would have had over the situation.

Would it be a better route to pay to have the damage fixed out of pocket and just sue her for it? (It's not just glass breakage, there are also big chips in the paint and creased dents down to the metal.)

,legaladvice,"I partially need some kind of legal advice and partially just a sanity check. If I’m just being too petty, please tell me that. 

This all started Summer/Fall of 2019, which is weird because I know this guy has been our neighbor for longer. I have also been pregnant since early September and don’t know what factor that plays (more on that later).

Back story/first interaction is long, but provides a somewhat important backdrop. My husband and I are in our 20s, quiet, and keep to ourselves. On top of that, I started online school June 2019 and find that even music and background tv distract me when I have to focus, so I keep our apartment kind of radio silent intentionally during my schooling. Our neighbor however is a very loud and generally unbothered person in general, he smokes and it reeks in our closets and bathroom which have shared walls, he is constantly hacking up a lung and spitting which I hear all the time, his little dog yaps often, he sometimes goes out to his truck and just revs it late at night with his bright headlights shining in our window, but on top of all of that he plays his tv all day every day at a volume where I can tell what he’s watching from my living room which is on the other side of the apartment from the shared wall, and his tv is also on the far side from the shared wall. 

Late fall 2019 it became too much, he had his door open, tv blasting into the breezeway and I could easily understand every word from his tv for over an hour while I was trying to focus on a paper. I considered just calling the police because I didn’t know him or how he would react, it was past 10pm, and I was home alone, but that felt like an overreaction and I hadn’t even given him a chance so I risked it and went over. He’s a 53 year old man and immediately started making excuses about commercials being loud, and said “What are you trying to go to bed or something?” (Yes.) I tried to be as nice but assertive as possible that commercials were not the problem (I normally just back down in situations like this). I said, “I’m not asking you to turn it off or to a volume where you can’t hear it, but it’s incredibly loud in my apartment, I’ve been hearing it for months, I’m just finally trying to nicely ask you to turn it down a couple notches”. He just acted bewildered I could hear it, turned it down drastically (still loud though to me in the same room as the tv) and said, “Can you hear this??” and I said, “Well...yeah, but if you can’t, you can turn it up, I was just honestly asking for you to turn it down like 2.” He kind of let up, did what I asked, and told me to test it out and let him know. I could still hear it but it was better so I told him that, thanked him, and appreciated that we came to somewhat of a compromise. Then he came over 5 minutes later and knocked on my door... He again asked if I could still hear it and I said “Well it’s a lot better, I do appreciate you turning it down” and then he started asking if we were here for good. Our doormat is another state flag (where we’re from), but I thought he was asking about this apartment specifically and answered that we’ve lived here for 2.5 years. So he asked, “Why don’t you buy a house?” and I said, “Uhh, we’ve got our reasons, why don’t you buy a house?” (probably sounds more aggressive than it was, I was just annoyed that my asking this man I don’t know to turn it down a bit is getting me grilled on major life decisions at 10pm, pregnant, home alone). He started to give me his divorce/home ownership story, but I kept it short and just said “Hey again, I appreciate it, have a good night.” 

Months go by, mostly no problems, but the tv gradually gets louder again. My husband keeps telling me it’s not a big deal, which in a way he’s right (he also isn’t able to hear it as well for some reason, which is why I wonder if pregnancy has made my ears extra sensitive) but it really gets to me that I can’t have a quiet living environment. This is our living space that we pay for, I don’t care what he does, but I don’t want to hear it. So I leave a note on his door, “Hey, we can hear your tv again every day, could you just bump it back down a couple? Thanks! :) -apt #.” He comes over as we’re on our way out to dinner the next night and asks us to come over, has his tv on a very reasonable volume, and says “You can hear this??” So I said, “This? No! I actually haven’t heard anything all day, but usually it’s game shows, Fox News, and booming base” (sounds like you’re in the hallway right outside a movie theater). So he points to his sound-bar and says it could be that, and I was like yes, it’s definitely that. He again tries to blame commercials and I again point out that I can identify the shows he’s watching from the other side of my apartment. He kinda shrugs and that’s all for that interaction, not much came of it. He’s kind of a belligerent person but not outright rude or crazy....or so I thought. 

Another month or so goes by and I’m home alone doing school and hear all of the sudden “n*****!” shouted super loud like 30 times over (my husband and I, and this neighbor are all white). By like the 10th time I’m honestly not sure where it’s coming from, thinking it could be from above me or outside, after like the 20th I’m concerned it’s a real altercation, someone is in danger and I need to call the police, but I wanted to identify where it was coming from first. So I stick my head out the door, don’t really hear anything, and then fully step out to see if it’s outside but distant. Well....this dude steps out into the breezeway too. Crap. He looks at me and questions why I’m out there and then thinking he came out to check the situation out too I said “Did you hear yelling too? Do you know what’s going on?” And he said “What!?” Very angrily. So I said, “Were you....yelling? Is everything okay?” And he. went. off. “Mind your business you stupid bitch.” I literally threw my hands up and said “Woah, I was just wondering...” and he cut me off, “Yeah you do a lot of that. Watch some tv you dumb bitch. Stupid motherf*cker.” At this point I’m overwhelmed and immediately go back in my apartment. I never planned on confronting anyone regardless of who it was, I was just concerned someone was not okay. But he stood in the breezeway for another good 3-5 minutes shouting insults at my door calling me all the things he already had to my face. I do really poorly with confrontation so I was shaking, I called my husband at work, and just decided that I wouldn’t call the police unless something further happened. This all seemed really out of character for what we had experienced before and pretty unstable and unwarranted to yell at a pregnant woman, but he didn’t specifically threaten me or anything so I didn’t want to bother the police with it. Later that night he turned the sound-bar on, turned it up super loud so that I could hear every word of Family Feud as if it was playing through my own tv and later played one of Trump’s speeches at almost the same volume while chanting “Donald Trump!” over and over. 

The whole thing had me really nervous. This was not honestly too long ago, I think early March. I went down to our management office the next day and basically just put them on notice about the whole situation. Everything up to that point. They called him and told him multiple people had complained about his noise level (true, I found out) and he needed to keep it down. He was belligerent, but I noticed a drop again in noise for a couple weeks. I asked if any of this would affect the renewal of his lease and they said not just this, but it if it was an ongoing situation, he had lots of complaints against him, and people felt unsafe it could. This was all from a new property manager, the previous one was terrible and was the reason I had never involved the office before. I avoid him at all costs now, I won’t speak to him and I avoid going outside when I know he’s out there, it’s just not a situation I can deal with since he escalated it.

However, one Saturday in April in the middle of the day he started playing a Trump speech very loud with his door open again for over an hour, and this time my husband was fed up. We could hear it over the show we were watching. So he went over there and said, “Turn it down or close your door”. Neighbor starts yelling at him that he needs to get away from his apartment and my husband just repeats it (he was heated for sure, but never went into neighbors apartment and never said anything else). So neighbor calls him all kinds of names too, tells him we need to move, and makes a move off his couch AT my husband. My husband just turned around and came back to our apartment, he really wanted to get into it with this guy but thankfully has a good head on his shoulders and was thinking about me and baby. So this time he called the police, I wasn’t over there, but he felt like the move wasn’t just getting up to have a conversation or the shut the door, it was threatening in nature. The deputy showed up about 20 minutes later, talked to us, and took a report, but like everything else up to this point nothing has technically happened so 1. He didn’t necessarily want to go talk to him and inflame the situation, and 2. He didn’t really do anything in the eyes of the law. My husband and I just feel like he could be slightly volatile though, with how he escalated from interactions 1 &amp; 2 to 3 &amp; 4 we’re not sure what the future could hold and want what’s happening now documented. As an aside,  he came and knocked on our door like 10 minutes after the deputy left but we didn’t answer because he’s not very predictable. 

The apartment manager told me to keep her updated, so we sent an update with this newest development, but didn’t receive a response, which was okay, we didn’t really need one. But we found out a few days later our apartment complex has been sold and is under new management. So now, part of my predicament is not knowing whether they know about this whole situation at all. I don’t want it to be 0-100 for them when we and the people around us have been having issues for months, but again nothing has really happened tangibly. 

However, tonight again he started yelling “f***ing n*****” repeatedly. Again, we’re both white, but this is really setting me off. On top of just being a generally obnoxiously loud chainsmoking, coughing/hacking, gross old man, with a loud tv and dog, he’s obviously a terrible racist. I have zero tolerance for that in my life, and yet I’m hearing it in my living space. Part of me wants to say it’s his apartment and it’s not my business, but it is 1000% affecting me. I am very close to having my baby now and 1. I can feel my blood pressure rise every time I hear him say that and stress is not good for baby, and 2. My baby might not be able to understand right away, but I honestly just don’t want them hearing it often either (this could be hormones, that and the fact that maybe my ears are sensitive for the same reason, are where I think pregnancy may come in). 

I don’t know if the tv noise will make it hard for baby to sleep during the day either, I am a light sleeper, but my husband is not so it remains to be seen. I am not under any impression that apartment living is 100% silent, I hear the people above us making normal living noises all the time, but this literal constant tv noise that I’m not choosing is driving me insane. 

At this point, I think in my head the best course of action is to go the new management and ask them 1. If they know about/still have record of everything, and 2. If his yelling racial slurs audibly through my wall affects anything legally on their end, like is it more of an offense than a loud tv? All of this is so borderline and seems inane, but I don’t know what to do about it. We can’t move, it’s just not an option right now, I can’t always have noise going to drown him out because of school and soon baby sleeping. I’m honestly concerned he’ll re-sign his lease if I don’t say anything, but I don’t know if I can do anything anyways. I’ll take whatever course of action they say to, but I’m honestly feeling at a breaking point where I want to complain to them every day I hear him yelling slurs and can hear his tv to where I can tell what he’s watching, or I’m going to start calling the police. Again, I don’t care what this guy does on his own time and in his own space, but this is affecting me so. much. 

I know this is so long, but I needed to get this out there even a little bit to rant. Does legal advice apply? Or do I just need a gut check? Am I being petty? Do I need to post this somewhere else? He annoys me, and he’s insanely disrespectful to women, POCs, and people in general, so to a degree I’m going to be petty. But I’m also over putting up with his BS so he can be comfortable and I have to suffer through. Please be honest and help me gain perspective on this mess.",t2_3bbyzg0j,False,,0,False,Neighbor is driving me up the (shared) wall,[],r/legaladvice,False,6,,0,False,t3_gfmabk,False,dark,0.8,,public,6,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Landlord Tenant Housing,False,6,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588940704.0,text,6,,,text,self.legaladvice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I partially need some kind of legal advice and partially just a sanity check. If I’m just being too petty, please tell me that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all started Summer/Fall of 2019, which is weird because I know this guy has been our neighbor for longer. I have also been pregnant since early September and don’t know what factor that plays (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back story/first interaction is long, but provides a somewhat important backdrop. My husband and I are in our 20s, quiet, and keep to ourselves. On top of that, I started online school June 2019 and find that even music and background tv distract me when I have to focus, so I keep our apartment kind of radio silent intentionally during my schooling. Our neighbor however is a very loud and generally unbothered person in general, he smokes and it reeks in our closets and bathroom which have shared walls, he is constantly hacking up a lung and spitting which I hear all the time, his little dog yaps often, he sometimes goes out to his truck and just revs it late at night with his bright headlights shining in our window, but on top of all of that he plays his tv all day every day at a volume where I can tell what he’s watching from my living room which is on the other side of the apartment from the shared wall, and his tv is also on the far side from the shared wall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late fall 2019 it became too much, he had his door open, tv blasting into the breezeway and I could easily understand every word from his tv for over an hour while I was trying to focus on a paper. I considered just calling the police because I didn’t know him or how he would react, it was past 10pm, and I was home alone, but that felt like an overreaction and I hadn’t even given him a chance so I risked it and went over. He’s a 53 year old man and immediately started making excuses about commercials being loud, and said “What are you trying to go to bed or something?” (Yes.) I tried to be as nice but assertive as possible that commercials were not the problem (I normally just back down in situations like this). I said, “I’m not asking you to turn it off or to a volume where you can’t hear it, but it’s incredibly loud in my apartment, I’ve been hearing it for months, I’m just finally trying to nicely ask you to turn it down a couple notches”. He just acted bewildered I could hear it, turned it down drastically (still loud though to me in the same room as the tv) and said, “Can you hear this??” and I said, “Well...yeah, but if you can’t, you can turn it up, I was just honestly asking for you to turn it down like 2.” He kind of let up, did what I asked, and told me to test it out and let him know. I could still hear it but it was better so I told him that, thanked him, and appreciated that we came to somewhat of a compromise. Then he came over 5 minutes later and knocked on my door... He again asked if I could still hear it and I said “Well it’s a lot better, I do appreciate you turning it down” and then he started asking if we were here for good. Our doormat is another state flag (where we’re from), but I thought he was asking about this apartment specifically and answered that we’ve lived here for 2.5 years. So he asked, “Why don’t you buy a house?” and I said, “Uhh, we’ve got our reasons, why don’t you buy a house?” (probably sounds more aggressive than it was, I was just annoyed that my asking this man I don’t know to turn it down a bit is getting me grilled on major life decisions at 10pm, pregnant, home alone). He started to give me his divorce/home ownership story, but I kept it short and just said “Hey again, I appreciate it, have a good night.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months go by, mostly no problems, but the tv gradually gets louder again. My husband keeps telling me it’s not a big deal, which in a way he’s right (he also isn’t able to hear it as well for some reason, which is why I wonder if pregnancy has made my ears extra sensitive) but it really gets to me that I can’t have a quiet living environment. This is our living space that we pay for, I don’t care what he does, but I don’t want to hear it.

My girlfriend asked the friend if they felt like they (the friend) was in danger, and she said no. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend and I are in Wisconsin, and the friend and her boyfriend are in New Mexico. Given that the boyfriend made a threat and has not actually been violent towards the neighbor, and seemingly the anger he had towards friend hasn&amp;#39;t manifested as abuse (according to friend), is there anything that we can encourage them to do, or do ourselves? (aside from encouraging them to look out for their own safety)&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"I graduated from the Academy and started field training with a local law enforcement agency in California, in January, 2020.

Long story short, I have witnessed first-hand that officers at this agency are intentionally using excessive force, and then lying about it on the police report.

In one incident, there was this domestic violence call that came out on the radio. I was dispatched along with several other officers. We arrived on scene and we saw the male suspect leaning against a garage. The officers next to me walked briskly towards him and then told him to turn around. I could already tell this guy had been drinking. The next thing I know, the officers grab him and bring him to the ground on his stomach with his head on the concrete. The male suspect didn't have any time to react or do anything. He was legitimately just standing there. Two officers get on top of him and one officer starts punching him in the face. I get on the ground and grab the male suspect's right arm. After some time, the officer who was punching him says to me, ""Taze him John! Taze him!""

At this point I'm thinking, ""What the hell? Taze him for what?"" Anyway, another officer who was on scene uses a drive-stun method and tases the guy on the ground. The guy starts squealing from pain.

Afterwards, one of the officers says ""Did you see him reach for my gun??"" And I'm thinking, ""Um..at no point did that happen.""

Later on, the officers are talking and one of them says to me ""Where were you John?? Why didn't you throw hands?"" (Throw hands is slang for throw punches). And the officer says to me that he gets pleasure out of fighting; he says ""it's better than cumming."" The officer that said the suspect reached for his gun says to me, ""we can write whatever we want in the report"" as he has like, this devious look on his face. At this point I'm thinking, ""so you used excessive force on a guy who wasn't fighting back, and then you lie in the report?""

I read the police report later on. It says directly that the male suspect placed a ""firm grip"" on the officer's gun handle with his right hand and ""pulled it away."" This never happened. How could it? I was holding on to his right arm the whole time.

On several occasions an officer has said to me, ""next time something happens, you BETTER throw hands John."" My response is always, ""Yes, sir.""

This is only one instance of several. Fights occur almost every other week at this city I work at. And I know that it's because these officers like to fight. they tell me they like to fight. They instigate fights. I've seen them get mad. I've seen them lose their cool. One time I heard two officers talk about a fight and one officer asked, ""So what happened?"" and the other officer responds, ""Well, he was being an asshole so..""

You might ask me why I haven't said anything to anyone. The reason is, this job is life/death. I have to seriously be aware of all the repercussions of every choice I make. If I ""whistleblow"", what happens if the officer gets mad at me? These are my coworkers, not my friends. And they have guns. I've already seen them get into fights because they got mad. Additionally, I need to maintain good relationships with them for my own safety. If I call for backup, I need them to respond. These are my reasons.

But now, I'm at a point where I'm being told that I have ""officer safety"" issues and they're going to recommend to admin that I don't continue field training, which means I would get fired. They said they would decide by next Monday after they review my case. And ""officer safety"" is notorious for law enforcement agencies when they want to articulate performance problems with the new trainee if they're trying to get rid of him. That's me. My performance has been as good as I could give. I gave 100% since day 1. They pushed me every minute of every shift, but I stayed with it. And I'm going to get punished because I refuse to bad things?

I'm not angry. The feeling I have is sadness. A deep, deep sadness.

I'm not very familiar with the legal system and wanted some advice on how to process. My grandmother who raised passed away a few months ago and I was in the middle of sorting things out with my family. In the middle of it I got an alert saying I had applied for a Marshalls credit card. The email that was used was my estranged mother's old name. She is a multi-time felon and constantly messages me and my brother and even stalked a close friend of mine each day at his workplace waiting to see me. I asked to void the application and the bank to send me details and I got so wrapped up with what we were doing that I never went to the police. Right afterward the pandemic started just as things finally settled down. I woke up this morning to another card from Discovery and this one was going through because she learned my legal name somehow.

How do I prove that it's her though and what would I need to show to convince them I have no relationship with her.

,legaladvice,"Hello! I'm very new to reddit sorry in advance. For reference I (26F) BF (26M) step son will be SS, his mother (28F) referred to as M and her oldest daughter will be J (9F).

My boyfriend has an adorable 4 year old son. He's been the primary caregiver since he broke up with his ex 3.5 years ago. They never got the courts involved but she's always been fine with BF having him.

Obviously I'm biased, but M's a selfish person. In the 2 years I have been with BF she has constantly changed when and how she is picking up her son, often giving us less then 24 hours notice of the changes and even failing to pick up her kid entirely. We already had plans to get a lawyer involved, I may have put my foot down saying I wanted things ironed out before marriage and BF agreed especially since the mom moved about 3 hours away several months ago so is seeing her son even less then she originally did.

M has 3 children with different men with SS being her youngest and J the oldest. Recently I was contacted by J's other parents on FB. They wanted to make sure that their daughter could still have contact with her brother since about a month ago M gave up her legal rights as her mother. We were shocked as this hadn't even been mentioned to us, we agreed that of course they would be able to see each other but asked for more information since this came out of left field.

I won't go into too specific details since we're talking about a Minor but basically J didn't want to live with her mother since M was forcing her to be a babysitter for both SS and her other child. When J lost our kid SS one day M punished her severely for it. We don't know how long our kid was lost or the type of punishment given and were never told of this incident. Not long after this J's dad got an attorney to fight for a change in custody agreement and at that time M gave up her rights as J's mom.

We had already planned on going forward legally but due to Covid-19 have had to postpone our plans for monetary reasons. Now though we're wondering if we should use this in our case against her, or if this would be good grounds to ask for full custody of SS instead of just officially having primary custody of him, or if this is just further complicating an already pretty straight forward case. We're just worried since not only do we not have a court order for him, but we also are having to rely on testimony from people we don't know well.

I should note we had contacted a lawyer before for a consultation who said that we already had a strong case and that the courts wouldn't make us change our current arrangement but would just make it legally binding/involve child support payments. This was after she had moved but before all this new information came out.

I've been renting an apartment for 3 years now and my landlord, who works in a very COVID impacted sector has decided to sell the building so I need to find new housing asap.

Apparently a relative with my same name has opened a few credit cards using my identity.  I will not file a police report as this relative is the primary caretaker for a disabled family member.  (They would be sent to a government run nursing home during the pandemic)

When I found this out my initial thought was to pay the debts but as things progressed I thought my money would be best used as savings than fixing the issue.

In hindsight - last year i had a weird knock at the back of my door.  When I asked who was there someone said they had paperwork for me and put papers that looked like junk mail at the back window.  I panicked and told them no one with name lived here.

Were those legal papers?  Would i be in trouble for ignoring them?

Hope all is well. I'm currently employed by a large telecommunication company.  Our main job is to host events.  Within these events, we interact with clients heavily, sell products  and migrate them to our platform.

I feared for my family and my own health. 

They have very little regards for their employees health concerns. I wouldn't want to take the unemployment route and it seems like they are given us an indirect ultimatum.  I'm looking for  some assistance/advice how best to approach this situation from a legal stand point  of view.

,legaladvice,"So towards the end of March (right before quarantine was enforced) I moved out of my apartment (in Colorado) to a new apartment (in Colorado).  I've moved plenty of times and my experience has always been about the same: about a month or two later I receive an itemized list for cleaning and damages and, if the landlord isn't terrible, a little bit of the security deposit back.  This time, I received an itemized list of cleaning and damages that was around $400 higher than the security deposit I had already paid with a note asking that I ""remit the balance immediately.""  They want me to pay them $400 more after I have already moved out.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I already have a semblance of a plan as to what to do about this.  Some of the itemized charges are blatantly against the lease and I believe I can negotiate with them to bring the charges back to the total of the security deposit.  I won't lie, I left some holes in the wall and I never expected to get the whole security deposit back.  It would be nice to get some of the money back, but if the security deposit is my payment to never deal with these people again, I guess that's okay.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my questions: is this even legal?  Can you charge someone more than their security deposit?  I've never heard of this happening and despite my best google I can't find anything.  It feels predatory and ridiculous to me but the last thing I want is this to go to collections and ding my credit score.  Any advice is much appreciated.

,legaladvice,"So for clarity, I’m 19 and my sister is 23. The car is in my name, not my parents. My sister doesn’t have a license, she was high on meth when she stole it, this is her 2nd time stealing one of the family cars, and she had another person (I don’t know who they are yet) in my car driving it as well. She returned it, she didn’t crash it or anything. She did it in the middle of the night and kept it for 6 ish hours, and she would have gotten away with it if I didn’t have dash cam that recorded everything. 


I know she was on meth because she said so in the footage, she also told the other person to keep quiet about it, and how the car belonged to me and not her and if they wanted to use it again, then they can’t let anyone know. The other person also left their backpack in the back seat, which contained a  inhaler and a container that very clearly had weed in it at one point. I’m not sure if they actually did drugs in the car, because there’s a moment when they turn the car off and nothings being recorded, but I know they had sex because they left a condom wrapper in my 1 year old daughters car seat cup holder.

When I went to the police station, told the officer everything, told them I had dash cam, and also said that our family was worried that she had someone living in our RV (we have a 3 acre property with woods in the back, where we keep the RV. She’s had people living in there before.) The officer never once asked to look at the footage, or offered to have someone inspect the RV for unwanted occupants. They said that as of that moment, there were no charges that he could press, and that he would call me if they wanted the footage. When I asked about the backpack he told me to “just throw it away” but then changed his mind and decided to take it because if the container actually had something in it, then he didn’t want me caught with it. 

That was basically it. Dad finally mustered up the courage to check the RV himself, he didn’t find anyone but there was evidence that someone had been living there. He locked it up.

,legaladvice,"I bought a brand new 2018 Ford Escape SE in June 2018 with 350 miles. After 11 months my car started to jerk as I was in reverse. I took it to the dealership (June 2019) that I bought it from to have it looked at. The coolant was low, so they topped it off and told me to keep an eye on it (this was a Thursday).  On Monday my car started to do the same thing, I checked my coolant and it was almost empty, so I called the dealership and they had me bring it back that evening.  They found that my coolant was draining into the engine, and stated that Ford was going to buy me a new engine.  The dealership had the car for 6 weeks. At this time my car only had 24,000 miles. I also found out that it was being rebuilt not a new motor.  I got my car back in the middle of July.  

The middle of August my car started to ride a little rough, so I again called the dealership and told them. I took the car to them and at this time they stated that they needed to do a computer update, I had told them that my engine was moving when I put it into gear and I thought that it may be a broken motor mount. 

In October I was rear ended so my car was in the repair shop for 4 weeks (Mid October-Mid November).  At the beginning of December I called the shop that repaired my car from my wreck and stated that my car was running rough and wondered if there could have been front end damage at the time of my wreck.  They contacted the dealership and took it to them, which they found that it needed a new motor mount (which I originally thought in August).  The dealership ordered the part and would call me when it came in.  

About a week later the part came in, and the day before it started to jerk again when I was reversing.  I checked my coolant and once again it was very low (below min level).  At this time my car now has right under 30000 miles.  I took the car back to the dealership to have the motor mount fixed and informed them the coolant was low. I expressed that I wanted to look into the lemon law because my car was doing the same thing that it had done before. I was informed that Ford would not do a buy back without trying to repair the car again. At this time they did a redesign rebuild engine which took another 5 weeks.  I got my car back in the middle of February 2020.  

A few weeks later I noticed that my cars start/stop had stopped working along with the traction control.  I looked under the hood for some reason and noticed my coolant was low again.  I contacted the dealership at which point we are on a first name basis and took it to them.  At first they were on board with filing a claim through Ford. They checked the car over and stated that I had a coolant leak but they were not sure where it was and that I needed an update for my start/stop. This was not an engine issue so no claim was filed.  

About 4 weeks ago I had to call because my car was making a rattling noise when hitting bumps. So again I took it in and they found that it had a loose wheel arm that needed to be replaced due to being off so many times, that was then replaced.  All was well until 2 days ago and big shocker my car engine is now making a knocking noise.  When looking it up it would appear to be a cracked block.  

A back story, when purchasing the car i was $4000 upside down in the car I traded in.  From my understanding if Ford were to buy back the car they would not refund the purchase price they would deduct the use of the car/mileage/etc. I have paid for this car for almost 2 years and now owe right at $24000, the car blue books for around $16000. (It now has rear end damage on the title) I cannot trade it in or I will be in worse shape than I started. If I do nothing eventually my warranty will run out. I put approximately 25,000 miles per year on my cars in the past.  So at this point I am at 36,000 and my warranty will only be good for about another year.

My uncle (U) is the son of my grandfather (G) who passed away in 2015. U is married to my aunt (A), and they’re kinda really... sketchy. 

U and A have filed for bankruptcy twice to my knowledge, and are really bad at handling finances (for the record). They’ve run more than one “business” that has failed catatonically. 

My grandpa had throat cancer, and was extremely out of it in the months before his passing. After my grandma (GA) passed in 2012, G gave me GA’s wedding band and told me he wanted me to have it because he did not trust U and A to not selling it. This was shortly after U and A’s bankruptcy. At this time G had no mental health issues, aside from his wife’s passing. He gave GA’s other ring to his first daughter for safe keeping for the same reason. U and A also had a small necklace that was willed to me by my great aunt and refused to give that to me for many years. 


In G’s original will I was willed either money or assets amounting to about $200k for college and starting my life. It is unknown if it was monetary or assets. Six months before his passing G and A were made to be his executor for his will, and two weeks before his passing his will was changed to where they were to receive everything and that no grand children would receive anything. 

U and A sold the family house, and moved to a lush home states away nearly immediately after his passing. They also have gone on several vacations and truly are living a plush life. 

It was stated by U and A that G “did not want it to be known of his passing”, which led to majority of the family not knowing of his passing, nor of his will being changed. It was not made known for over a month that he passed, and not until years later that his will was changed so soon to his passing. 

I can confirm these events and information with nearly any and all of my family. 

Was it legal of them to change his will two weeks before his passing? 

Is it worth following through with a lawyer?

What type of lawyer would one talk to about this?

While that extra money would be extremely helpful I am more upset over the fact that they took advantage of someone who trusted them so greatly in his final moments. I want to go to college, but financially it’s impossible.

&lt;p&gt;What type of lawyer would one talk to about this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that extra money would be extremely helpful I am more upset over the fact that they took advantage of someone who trusted them so greatly in his final moments. I want to go to college, but financially it’s impossible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any advice!&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"Hey guys, 21 year old male from NY.

Today I was driving my yellow Hyundai in the right hand lane on a main road where I live. A red kia soul was a little infront of me in the left lane. All of a sudden the red kia decided to cut in front of me and turn right to a side road. I inevitably hit him on his right side, he continued driving and stopped a block away. He got out to look the damage. I got out to ask him to come back. He started freaking out and was seriously angry and I felt threatened. About 10 peoples from the surrounding houses, cars, and businesses all came out to my 'rescue' and this guy got back in his kia and drove off. I had the cops come and me and my 2 passengers gave statements, and 2 witnesses idle at the red light of the intersection who saw the whole thing gave statements. The whole event was on multiple cameras, and the police officer pulled up the video and told me that the red kia was at 100% liability. My car had to get towed as it was not able to be driven. After the whole event I get home and about an hour after the impact, I start getting neck pain and one of my passengers is dizzy with a headache. We both go to urgent care, I cat x-rays and cat scans and am told that I have pretty bad whiplash in my neck and back, and that my muscle strain is equivalent to someone days into whiplash, so it'll get bad. The doctor told me not to work for 4 days at least, and if I do go back be very careful (I'm a cashier). My passenger has a mild concussion and is told to rest for a week and avoid mental strain. They are scheduled to start a new job at a children's orphanage home as an intern next week. I call the police to update my report with our injuries, they inform that a woman called about how they were involved in a hit and run. They said that a yellow car hit them dead on and drove off. They also said this occurred on the opposite side of town from where the accident actually happened, AND they are trying to blame me for all of it. She also said she was driving her red kia, with her boyfriend and her mother as passengers. That wasn't even true, the boyfriend was driving the car, and the mother was the only passenger. The police officer told me they knew that they were blatantly lying, and that the hit and runners would be coming into the station and be charged with hit and run from personal injury and submitting a false police claim. He also told me that they are clearly at 100% fault. This whole ordeal took up atleast 7 to 8 hours. This all took place on camera and the red kia is obviously at fault. This is also during the middle of me and my passenger's finals week at school, and we can't think straight. We're scared to drive or even ride in a car, it was both of our first accidents and it was very traumatic. We are both very anxious in general and this is the last thing we needed. 

Phew... that was the story. Hopefully you're still with me. My question is, what are my next steps? Should I sue them? I emailed a personal injury lawyer, but I'd hate to have to spend money on all of their work or time and then find out I have no claim to anything. I don't really know how suing works and I would hate to get in trouble, or reverse sued or something like that. I mostly want justice for the whole ordeal, this guy looked very scaring and threatening and I'm honestly worried of retaliation if I pursue legal action. What do I need in order to sue him? Is it worth it usually? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Hopefully I managed to make it a somewhat interesting read.

Thank you so much for anything.

Edit: forgot to mention, not sure how important this is.

My parents recently decided to enter the housing market and have found a house that they would like to purchase. It's going for $499k and they offered $495k. I don't know where they are exactly in the process, but the real estate agent's client (the one trying to sell the house) has an attorney that would like to change the terms of the offer.

They haven't been in this position before and would like clarification. Here are the terms:

1. Use a binder form instead of a contract form before the inspection
2. Inspection to be done within 10 calendar days as opposed to 10 business days (why is this important?)
3. 12 calendar days to the formal contract signing
4. 35 calendar days for the mortgage (parents have already been approved)
5. Deposit check to be made out to our attorney's firm for holding
6. Title search date to be moved up to be 10 calendar days (what is this?)
7. List price of $499k (taken care of)

My company has filed for NYS Shared Work, effective 3/28. This program is a ""wage replacement"" program, intended to allow a company to weather economic downturns and replace layoffs with a complete wage cut of an entire unit. My company chose to cut hours 20% and not lay off any employees. I'm very thankful that my company has kept us all employed rather than choosing to lay off to survive this downturn. 

We were instructed to apply for the program and told we would have a 20% hours-cut, which NYS workshare would ""cover"", by replacing 20% of our wages with 20% of our weekly benefit rate on NYS unemployment. In addition to this, the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program would kick in another $600 weekly, beginning the following week for anyone receiving funds from any NYS unemployment program.  This includes anyone on any kind of ""reduced hours"" program. 

It's prudent at this point to give some personal background and explain how CT comes into play. On 6/7/2019, through no fault of my own, I was laid off of my job in CT. I was fortunate to not have to use the entire 26 weeks of my CT unemployment benefits and began working in NY after 22 weeks of searching for a new position. Though my claim through CT ended when I stopped claiming benefits in October, the claim does not ""expire"" until 1 full calendar year from it's inception (6/6/2020). 

Last week (5/1/2020), I was contacted by NYS Shared Work and told that I would likely be found ineligible to claim NYS Shared Work Benefits because I had an ""open"" claim in CT with money remaining on it (as I had not used the full 26 weeks of benefits and 1 year had not yet passed). I was told I cannot have 2 ""open"" claims in 2 different states; despite my CT claim being complete and being for unemployment, not shared work. I got a follow up call today saying that this is the case and I am going to be denied NYS benefits and should see about claiming benefits through CT. 

I feel I am not going to be able to claim benefits through CT. As my employer is a NYS employer, it is not eligible for the CT Shared Work Program, even though the CT Shared Work Program will give an employee the same ""percent replacement"" of hours plus the FPUC payment. Additionally, the CT maximum benefit for unemployment while employed ""part time"" is cut by 2/3 of your gross earnings against the weekly benefit rate. In this case, someone earning over 970 would over-earn any money that the state would provide and thus make you ineligible for the additional $600 that the FPUA Program is providing. This is the situation in which I find myself. 

I feel like I'm in a massive catch loop here. I've circled unemployment law and see no legitimate reason for denial. I see nothing in NYS Shared Work under which I should be denied this claim.

,legaladvice,"So backstory of important information:

I am a dental professional that works on a percentage of collections (example: service costs $100. Insurance pays $70. My pay is $70 times my percentage because that is what is collected). However, when I started last June with this employer, I was on a daily base pay until December (For example, $100/day or percentage of collections. Whichever is greater). Then in January, it switched to only the percentage without the base pay. I’m a w2 employee and have Health benefits through my employer.

We have been off for a little over a month due to COVID-19, but are officially opening our doors on Monday after my employer got the PPP loan this week. They said we all must come back to work and off unemployment. Cool. Scary time to be in someone’s mouth, but people need dentistry so it is what it is.

I was informed by my employer today that since the loan was based on 2019 wages, I would be paid the greater of a base pay for the next 8 weeks or percentage of collections. That’s great news! My collections will be almost nonexistent the next 8 weeks due to no one wanting to come to the dentist. 

Then they hit me with the sketchy part:
If the pay over the next 8 weeks exceeds my collections, they plan to garnish my wages to recoup the excess. So say they pay me $10,000 in 8 weeks, but I only make $7,000 from collections (hopeful at this point).That means they will be garnishing in increments $3,000 from my pay check after the 8 weeks. Following the money, they get the PPP money and spend it on my payroll to get it forgiven, then garnish my wages to get back forgiven payroll money. Meanwhile I’m being pulled off unemployment, stuck with the risk of no collections and essentially a 0% payday advance loan. I’m the only non-hourly employee at the office, so I have no one to compare this to. Is this legal? I really feel like I’m getting the bad end of the stick here. Thanks for any insights.

Before COVID, we had extended our lease from end of April until end of May. After COVID, we no longer needed the extension because my boyfriend and I would not be physically graduated and we also aren’t working as we are non-essential. We asked the landlord to cancel the extension and he said no. 
That’s fine, we tried to find someone to sublet, but no luck. 
The landlord was able to find someone that was interested so I sent videos of the apartment and also emailed with the prospective tenant at the request of the landlord. They even came and toured while we waited outside. Now, the prospective tenant has backed out. 
They were supposed to move in May 15th, and we were told our move our day was to be May 10th and that the rent would be prorated. This is written in an email. Most of our belongings are out and in a storage unit already. 
We have yet to pay May rent because we were waiting for the prospective tenant to sign the lease but now that they backed out, our landlord is asking for rent for the full month. We don’t have that money.

Also posted in &lt;a href=""/r/advice""&gt;r/advice&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the story: 
Before COVID, we had extended our lease from end of April until end of May. After COVID, we no longer needed the extension because my boyfriend and I would not be physically graduated and we also aren’t working as we are non-essential. We asked the landlord to cancel the extension and he said no. 
That’s fine, we tried to find someone to sublet, but no luck. 
The landlord was able to find someone that was interested so I sent videos of the apartment and also emailed with the prospective tenant at the request of the landlord. They even came and toured while we waited outside. Now, the prospective tenant has backed out. 
They were supposed to move in May 15th, and we were told our move our day was to be May 10th and that the rent would be prorated. This is written in an email. Most of our belongings are out and in a storage unit already. 
We have yet to pay May rent because we were waiting for the prospective tenant to sign the lease but now that they backed out, our landlord is asking for rent for the full month. We don’t have that money. 
So, what do we do? What is legal for us to do? Do we just pay for the 10 days or will our security deposit be taken? Please help!&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"We live in an apartment complex where they typically charge extra for pets. ($20-$50 depending on the size of the pet) When we first moved in October of 2018 the then-manager waived our pet fee for the duration of the year-long lease. 

Last October we wanted to renew for 6 more months (November 2019-May 2020) but the company couldn't get their online resident portal to accept the terms of our lease. We paid our rent in the meantime(and have never ever been late on our rent in the year and half we've been here) although we were not technically under lease at that point. Not really the point of the story, but we were showing some good faith.

When they finally got the portal to accept the 6 months instead of the 18 they initially had put in, they had raised the rent by 3% due to ""property improvements."" (They redid the roof in July.) At this point it was November 20, and our lease had run out at the end of October. I pointed out the hassle with the lease and how it made me uncomfortable, and they decided to waive the pet fee again. HOWEVER, I did not specifically get ""we are waiving your pet fee"" in writing. 

What we did get was a lease where the rent is disclosed thus:

""6.Rent and Charges. Unless modified by addenda, you will pay $1100.00 per month for rent, payable in advance and without demand at the on-site manager's office, or at our online payment site, or at the leasing office"" There's more in that portion about late charges but that's it. 

We signed on November 26, and they counter-signed on December 2.

Now, fast forward almost 7 months, we have found a house and are closing mid-June. We notified the office in April of our intent to vacate after June 31, and got a confirmation email saying the same, and that no paperwork needed to be done as the way our lease is worded, if you do not notify of your intent to vacate at the end of your lease, it is assumed you are going month-to-month and accept a 10% increase in rent. 

During the covid shutdown, some of the tenants have organised a rent strike (we are not taking part and have continued to pay our rent on time) and the property management company has responded by offering a 10% discount on May's rent to anyone who paid their April rent on time, and a $50 discount on May if you pay May on time, and a $100 discount if you pay June on time. Not generous, but you can see how it might get complicated. So, to total that up, we paid 940 this month for rent. 

This discounts threw the resident portal system into complete meltdown, everyone got outstanding balance warnings, the management company sent out a disclaimer saying ""yeah we know you got warning notifications about your rent, we can't change that part of the system or else it will break."" Now the company has had to dig through the balances and accounts individually to calculate if each person has paid their appropriate rent for this month, and contact each of them.

Lo and behold, our account has a balance of 299.45.  That's $160 from the discount that the system thinks we owe, and 7 months of pet rent at $20/mo, less $0.55 from interest gained on our deposit that they just took. The person in the office sent out a pretty aggressive email to my wife asking her to pay the whole balance, first denying that we were entitled to the discount because the $140 balance made us unqualified for any of the discounts. They relented on that after a few emails from us decrying the lack of any notification of the balance being accrued over the 7 months, but still insist we owe the pet rent because we don't have anything in writing that says ""it was waived."" 

Now, I looked into the pet addendum in the lease and it says:
 ""4. Additional Animal Rent. Your total monthly rent (as stated in the Lease Contract) has been increased by $20.00 by your request to maintain an animal in the unit. The monthly rent amount in Provision 6 of the Lease Contract includes this additional rent. This amount is not a deposit and is in consideration of our allowing the option to maintain and animal."" Nowhere else on the addendum does it say anything about monthly charges. Other addendums in the lease have applicability/conflict clauses where the conflict is controlled by the addendum, but the animal addendum does NOT. 

Therefore I sent an email with both of those quotes, pointing out that the animal rent was included in our rent, and in our interpretation of the lease we have fulfilled the contract. I also stated I was willing to discuss what other ways ""includes this additional rent"" could be interpreted, as I do not wish to burn any bridges, and I would be willing to pay pet rent for our last two months, if they would drop all the other balances.  

My wife is now terrified that they are going to make trouble for our closing on the house, and wants to just pay.  I would rather not, because they are really rude, poorly organised company, and dealing with them is a nightmare every time. Not to mention I think charging 7 months is BS since we signed at the end of November after paying a month with no lease.

 So, I believe my long-winded question is: Do they have any leg to stand on with the way the lease is worded? I can see how it could be interpreted both ways, but I believe the way I am understanding it is the right way.",t2_4jxip,False,,0,False,Property management company wants to charge back rent for a pet.

I signed onto a year long lease with a property management company last September and ended up getting a new job out of state and am trying to move out at the end of this month (May 31st). According to my lease, I have to pay a $570 fee to end the lease early and give thirty day notice.

,legaladvice,"Best friend just called me in tears. Here’s some background....
Him and I both are recovering alcoholics. I’ve been fortunate to be in a sober house during covid, him not so much. He’s struggling. Him and his girlfriend are currently both active alcoholics. She is however far worse than he is. 
She is much younger, early twenties. And he is in his early forties. They’ve been together a while and were doing great until shelter in place followed by relapse happened. Now, he has an ex wife and an abuse charge due to his drunken shouting. Never laid a hand on her but as you and I know that doesn’t really matter. His girlfriend knows this.... here’s where the problem starts... he has been trying to get her and him off the booze. She’s violently against that idea. Last week he hid her vodka and in response she called the police and said he was beating her. 

Tonight a similar thing happened. She was upset he wouldn’t go to the liquor store for her and she called his ex wife saying he was abusing her. Then called the police. He was held at gunpoint by seven policemen. They left after realizing there wasn’t really any danger and finding the girlfriend severely intoxicated.

Now my question is.... what can I do to help him? His ex wife is thankfully on his side and willing to come get him as he’s currently crying on the front porch terrified to go inside. How can he get out of this situation? I mean legally too....he hasn’t been charged with anything (yet) but she seems likely to try to get him arrested if he leaves. I’m just worried with his record he could be quickly found guilty of something....anything really. 

I guess I’m just hoping for advice. I told him already he needs to leave the house now. He’s drunk unfortunately so can’t drive but he said he is willing to take his ex wife up on her coming to get him and letting him crash at her place tonight.

Here’s some background....
Him and I both are recovering alcoholics. I’ve been fortunate to be in a sober house during covid, him not so much. He’s struggling. Him and his girlfriend are currently both active alcoholics. She is however far worse than he is. 
She is much younger, early twenties. And he is in his early forties. They’ve been together a while and were doing great until shelter in place followed by relapse happened. Now, he has an ex wife and an abuse charge due to his drunken shouting. Never laid a hand on her but as you and I know that doesn’t really matter. His girlfriend knows this.... here’s where the problem starts... he has been trying to get her and him off the booze. She’s violently against that idea. Last week he hid her vodka and in response she called the police and said he was beating her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight a similar thing happened. She was upset he wouldn’t go to the liquor store for her and she called his ex wife saying he was abusing her. Then called the police. He was held at gunpoint by seven policemen. They left after realizing there wasn’t really any danger and finding the girlfriend severely intoxicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my question is.... what can I do to help him? His ex wife is thankfully on his side and willing to come get him as he’s currently crying on the front porch terrified to go inside. How can he get out of this situation? I mean legally too....he hasn’t been charged with anything (yet) but she seems likely to try to get him arrested if he leaves. I’m just worried with his record he could be quickly found guilty of something....anything really. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I’m just hoping for advice. I told him already he needs to leave the house now. He’s drunk unfortunately so can’t drive but he said he is willing to take his ex wife up on her coming to get him and letting him crash at her place tonight. They are friendly, and have a wonderful kid together. She wants the best for him. And knows he isn’t an abusive guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this follows the rules. I’m sorry gang I didn’t know where else to go for advise.&lt;/p&gt;

Hey, all. I don't know how wise turning to reddit is, but I'm feeling kind of desperate. Quick preface, I live in a very small town. Also, my mom holds a respected position in the city's government.

Anyway, My mom decided to pay me a visit this past monday night. She had heard from someone that I relapsed into drinking, and wanted to come discipline me or something (I'm 24 btw.) Around 9 p.m. I was asleep on my couch, she came into my house unannounced, despite being intoxicated herself. (BTW Her doing this revealed that she had the extra house key that I've been missing for a while.) I told her to leave, but she refused. When the verbal fighting escalated into yelling, and she still wouldn't leave, I tried using force to get her out of my house. I really just tried pushing her towards the door. She then ran to my kitchen, and grabbed a knife. When I tried approaching her again, she started slashing the knife at me. She did injure me. Nothing life threatening, but I did need to get 5 stitches on my left arm, and I have a long knife wound on my abdomen. She then said, verbatim, ""I'm calling the cops, and they will believe whatever I say."" She then left, got into her car, and drove away. I immediately called 911, told them what happened, called a friend to meet me at the ER, and walked to the ER (The hospital is literally right across the street from me.) Cut to the ER. A doctor is questioning me and stitching me up. Two police officers then arrive. One starts questioning me about everything that transpired, and the other starts questioning my friend about IDK what. I'm thinking he was taking my report statement, but then he asks if I had her phone and glasses. Apparently she dropped them when running to her car. I didn't have them, and the officer quit asking me questions, but neither of them left. The doctor then discharged me, and started walking my friend and I to the exit. As soon as we got there, one of the officers took my discharge papers from the doctor, and the other one arrested me. ARRESTS ME. Apparently my mom also called 911 and told them I hit her and refused to let her leave my house, assault and false imprisonment, which are both being charged as felonies. My friend, the doctor, and all nurses nearby were shocked. The doc even started arguing with the arresting officer. He doesn't even read my rights. Now, I have a lot of potential unstable depressive mood disorders. So, I start screaming, and crying, and yelling suicidal thoughts. The officer tried booking me to the jail, but the jail counselor, who thank GOD was actually there, told him to do an EPC interview with a psychiatrist. I qualified to be taken to a psych ward. I stayed there until today, when I was released. Instead of having to sit in jail I just have the citations. I'm still scared, however, because since I've been released, 5 hours ago, I've been stopped by police several times. They ask if I'm drunk, and one asked if I was someone who had just shoplifted at a nearby store. This all sounds bizarre, but I'm scared to even leave my house. My mom has done similar things with lying about people to the police before, and theyve gone to jail and even prison! Are there any legal actions I can take to fight this, or do I just hide in my house until court? This is very crazy, but I sincerely hope somebody has come advice for me. Much love\~

One year ago I moved into an apartment in Chicago, IL with 2 other people. The rent was $1,600 per month and we split it up so that myself and one roommate, we'll call him James, would each pay $500 and the roommate who got the master bedroom, we'll call him Tony, was on the hook for the remaining $600. At first, Tony was in charge of mailing in the rent check, so James and I would paypal him our share and then he would send the check. April rent got sent and everything was fine. May came along and James and I sent Tony our money and assumed the he was getting it to the landlords. Turns out he used our money to fund some cocaine and his girlfriend's abortion. Then Tony loses his job and/or just blows his paycheck before saving enough for rent or enough to pay me and James back. So we are late for May. The whole time James and I are working and saving up and having our share of the rent on time. June passes and then July comes around and Tony STILL has not come up with any money. Landlords call and I explain the situation and decide, ""Fine, I'll just pay everything we owe the landlords and Tony's just gonna have to be in debt to me so we don't end up getting evicted."" Long story short, Tony never gets his act together, the three of us get evicted, and when all is said and done, Tony owes me $1,800, owes James $600, and even ends up owing MY PARENTS $500. The eviction was in January 2020 and now, 4 months later, it appears Tony is dodging my messages and calls and I just want to put an end to this and try to get my money back. What can I do here?

At 4, after no call, I called him and all he said was it was definitely the power steering and the AC compressor would be there tomorrow. I again, asked how much it would cost. He said he’d get the price for me and call me right back in two minutes.

,legaladvice,"Hey Reddit, I currently live in Alberta. On April 14th I ordered a firearm from a retail location in Ontario. These firearms typically take 3-4 weeks to order, assemble, and ship. My payment was made via e-transfer on April 14. I've heard no progress reports since. 

Of course the recent gun ban on May 1st moved my gun into the prohibited class. I have a PAL and RPAL but nothing beyond the basics. 

I immediately emailed the store, wondering what would happen and assuming a refund as the product hadn't even shipped yet. I waited a few days and called, left voicemails, and called again. Finally I reached someone over the phone who told me they were still navigating the issue as there are many, many more people in similar positions to myself. 

Today, May 7th, the store called me to ask for my PAL number. Apparently the number on the order was incorrect. I indicated that because the firearm was now prohibited, they couldn't sell it to me and I should be refunded. The rep on the phone told me that technically I had already been sold the weapon and they were just returning my weapon to my possession. They can't refund it, because that would involve another transfer of ownership which is now illegal because the weapon is now prohib. 

I took that answer on the phone, but thinking on it further I believe that the firearm wasn't actually sold to me until today; they didn't have my correct PAL number and therefore couldn't have legally transferred ownership until now.

Background: I've had a lot of issues with my landlord and the property management company over the past few years I've lived there. My heater has been broken for two years that required a new heater to be put in. They never got me a new one. Additionally, I had called my landlord on multiple occasions a few months ago (who is ALWAYS putting off tasks, claiming he would come around and never does) about the leaking kitchen sink.  He said he would come with a new faucet and never did. I placed a bucket underneath the sink, but I think the cabinet underneath has some water damage. Am I liable for the water damage?

I'm moving out. I had messaged that I wanted to mail the company office my unit keys, and they said okay. I later asked if a signature at the time of delivery would be okay, and they said no. I don't want to meet my half-assed landlord because he would keep me waiting all day (if he even shows up). My key would probably be mailed to them fine, but I don't want to be liable if it's not. This may not be a legal issue, but I'm not sure what to do here. Also the lease is over at the end of this month, and I've already moved out (the first to move out of my roommates).  In the initial email the management company sent out, they said I can request an initial inspection before the final one. The company denied me of it, saying that my other roommates must be moved out before an inspection is done. Are they legally allowed to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

I work at a locally owned hotel and have been working there nearly a year. Until this morning my roommate also worked at the hotel.

I work front desk, my roommate works housekeeping. We have different supervisors and make a point to operate as separate entities at work, one doesn't speak for the other, etc.  


This is relevant because this morning my roommate quit. Things have been rough for the hotel since the virus, and most of housekeeping was being called off daily. Roommate had been called off 3/4 days for 2 months. This morning he was called to work at a separate hotel owned by the boss and turned it down asking to be removed from the schedule. The owner has suggested more than once HK find other work if they don't like the hours.

(As a side note, staff overall have been stressed and frustrated. We've been brought down to a skeleton crew with everyone on the edge of overtime. One of the front desk staff put in their two weeks notice a few days ago)

It's my day off today (and the next), things went down with the roommate this morning (from what I overheard it was a civil conversation with the HK lead), this afternoon my boss called me.   
The first thing he asked was ""Why did \[Roommate\] quit?""   
He hadn't tried to call my roommate or speak with him at all today. I was stunned by the question but replied that he would have to talk to roommate about it, I hadn't spoken to him about it   
He then asked outright ""Are you going to quit""  (I'd been considering it for what I hope is obvious reasons, but hadn't brought up my thoughts to management and had intended to give two weeks notice, etc)   
I said ""I haven't put in my notice"" as a reflex, I was stunned since the start of the conversation.   
He said okay and that he needed to plan, then asked if I would work tomorrow.   
I turned it down and when he started trying to promise more hours I told him I'd speak about schedules on Saturday.   


He called my roommate 20 minutes later to ask about reasons, try to offer hours again, etc.   


My questions:  
Would it be legal to record a conversation with my boss without letting him know I am recording if I'd like a record of the conversation?   
Is it illegal for my boss to ask if I'm going to quit?   


I know there's not  much that can happen legally and a lawsuit isn't really practical, but I'm hoping to get a better idea of my rights going into that conversation Saturday

I don't know what to do, I'm 21 and I live at home with my mother who frequently gets beaten by my stepfather. I feel like a horrible person for 'allowing' this.

I got into so many verbal and physical arguments already but it won't stop. I have been trying to seek help for so long, but the cops won't do anything, even though I have plenty of photo and video evidence, because they claim that he doesn't have anything on his criminal record. 

The thing is, me and my mother are financially dependent of him, we don't have any family we can rely on so moving out isn't really a plan.
I have tried seeking help already from financial organisations (I'm from Belgium, so in my case it's OCMW) but they won't help me.

I just want to know how I can get out of this situation, my mom doesn't want to live anymore, and I feel like a failure that I can't do anything.

I really want to move out with my mother and I want to live in a small appartment with her, but she refuses to move out because she wants to keep forgiving him and give him more chances.

I recently graduated high school so my plan is to financially support me and my mother after my graduation of university so we can move out of this hellish household, even though she doesn't want to, I would have the time to convince her, the problem with that is, that it will last at least another 4 years before I graduate university, and my mother definitely won't survive 4 more years of this hell. She's telling me frequently how that she doesn't want to live anymore and only doesn't give up because of me.
My father is also trying to sabotage my school,because he knows that when I finish it, that it's game over for him and that we wont need him anymore.


If there are some people from Belgium, or some people who know a lot about this, is there any other financial aid that I can contact? Also what steps should I take to at least lessen the burden that my mother is carrying.

,legaladvice,"I have a room for rent in my house. Someone, let's call him John, contacted me on craigslist and we set up a chat on Zoom. We got along well enough, although I had some reservations (he has requested I hire a cat sitter if I go out of town for the weekend, he won't do any house or yard work because he ""doesn't care about how things look"", he wants a longer contract than I am really comfortable with, and wants to move in a week earlier than I want). He came to look at the house and then spent the next few days looking at other places. John emailed me a few days ago and said he wanted to move in to my place. I had concerns, but he seemed nice enough and I need the extra money, so I said okay and I would send him a contract.

I emailed him a draft of the standard contract in our state (paid like $30 for it and it was fine for previous tenants) so he could look it over. He came back with a lot of requests including adding verbiage from state code that had been repealed giving him additional legal rights if any part of the contract is broken (even if he is the one to break it). He also wanted me to include guaranteed parking (there is a spot and I told him he is welcome to park there, but there are other people that park there too, and there is plenty of street parking, but he wants a guaranteed on property spot), a promise in the contract to have the AC fixed within a short time frame because he doesn't deal with heat well, and some other things that I am not very comfortable with (two pages of requests). He is also trying to argue about which utilities he should have to pay for because when I said ""share the utilities"" when we talked he didn't think I meant trash and gas (he knew the house uses gas for cooking). Furthermore, he wants me to increase my homeowners insurance because the rental coverage I have covers my stuff he is using (fully furnished room) and loss of renter income if something happens to the house, but it doesn't cover any of his stuff. He doesn't want to be liable for his things if something like a pipe bursts in the house because that isn't his fault.

While John was reviewing the contract, I had a couple other people contact me, one of whom is getting a job with some people I know. We click well and he wants to rent for the exact time frame I was looking for.  I would be much more comfortable renting space in my house to him AND he said he'd pay $175 more than John each month ""and it is still the best price in the are by far!""

What is my legal obligation to John? I did say he could move in, which is why I gave him the draft of the contract. But I am really nervous about someone who wants me to include things in the contract like I have to pay for all legal fees regardless of what the outcome of any case is. What he wants seems aggressive and I was already not completely comfortable with him and this is really off putting. Is it too late for me to back out since he turned down other places already? Can I say no to his requests and say we aren't a good fit and end it there? If I say no to his requests, and he wants to sign the contract anyway, do I have to follow through with it? Nothing is signed by ether party right now.

What are my options and what can I say at this point that won't put me in a bad legal position with him since he is clearly into lawsuits?

Someone, let&amp;#39;s call him John, contacted me on craigslist and we set up a chat on Zoom. We got along well enough, although I had some reservations (he has requested I hire a cat sitter if I go out of town for the weekend, he won&amp;#39;t do any house or yard work because he &amp;quot;doesn&amp;#39;t care about how things look&amp;quot;, he wants a longer contract than I am really comfortable with, and wants to move in a week earlier than I want). He came to look at the house and then spent the next few days looking at other places. John emailed me a few days ago and said he wanted to move in to my place. I had concerns, but he seemed nice enough and I need the extra money, so I said okay and I would send him a contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I emailed him a draft of the standard contract in our state (paid like $30 for it and it was fine for previous tenants) so he could look it over. He came back with a lot of requests including adding verbiage from state code that had been repealed giving him additional legal rights if any part of the contract is broken (even if he is the one to break it). He also wanted me to include guaranteed parking (there is a spot and I told him he is welcome to park there, but there are other people that park there too, and there is plenty of street parking, but he wants a guaranteed on property spot), a promise in the contract to have the AC fixed within a short time frame because he doesn&amp;#39;t deal with heat well, and some other things that I am not very comfortable with (two pages of requests). He is also trying to argue about which utilities he should have to pay for because when I said &amp;quot;share the utilities&amp;quot; when we talked he didn&amp;#39;t think I meant trash and gas (he knew the house uses gas for cooking). Furthermore, he wants me to increase my homeowners insurance because the rental coverage I have covers my stuff he is using (fully furnished room) and loss of renter income if something happens to the house, but it doesn&amp;#39;t cover any of his stuff. He doesn&amp;#39;t want to be liable for his things if something like a pipe bursts in the house because that isn&amp;#39;t his fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While John was reviewing the contract, I had a couple other people contact me, one of whom is getting a job with some people I know. We click well and he wants to rent for the exact time frame I was looking for.  I would be much more comfortable renting space in my house to him AND he said he&amp;#39;d pay $175 more than John each month &amp;quot;and it is still the best price in the are by far!&amp;quot; (it is quite a steal actually).&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"This is in New York State. I've changed details to protect identities, but the gist is the same. 

First time homebuyers. Back in February we found a decent house with a single owner that was within our price range (~$350k), but higher than we ideally wanted to go. We kept our eye on it, but continued our search. We eventually circled back to it, and by that point the price had come down to $328k. Quarantine orders started just before we made our initial offer of $313k, expecting the seller to counter us up to $320k, but to our surprise (and that of our realtor) the seller accepted without countering. We suspected it was due to the shift in market balance; a lot of people ended their searches for a house. We now suspect a different motivation.

Since that point, the seller has made life exceedingly difficult for us. The seller's realtor told me at an open house that he had obtained an expensive certificate we needed for an application with the house to save a lot of money-- turns out he didn't, and now it's required. He impeded our home inspection by initially not allowing us to inspect a sealed section of the house; we eventually were allowed to send a contractor out to install an access panel. He refused to repair any of the home inspection failings, even after we offered up to $750 as part of the contract to cover inspection-related repairs (as a show of good faith that we wouldn't nickel-and-dime him). He initially refused to sign the property inspection stating that the A​C-- which was too cold for our inspector to test-- would need to be in functional condition at closing, saying he's ""bitter about taking the low offer"" and ""not inclined to do us any favors.""

Fast forward to this week. After waiting weeks and weeks for the search and survey, well past when they were contractually due, the search revealed that the house had a judgme​nt of fore​closure less than a week before the house was listed for sale. On the contract, which all parties signed a month _after_ the foreclo​sure, the seller checked ""No"" to ""Co​urt Ord​ers"" and ""Fore​c​losure"" in the Sel​ler's Disc​lo​sures. I found a public record of the forecl​osure in county filings. I also found that there's a lawsuit of the bank vs the seller dated a couple months before the foreclo​sure. Boy, do I wish I made that search sooner.

Our attorney is still gathering details, but what we know is:

- The selling agent knew about the for​eclosure and reportedly included it on a listing page ""only available to agents""; she says she's ""100% confident"" it won't be an issue with the sale (uh, what?)
- Our agent didn't see it, and thus didn't bring it up
- The seller did not tell his real estate lawyer, who was equally shocked when he told ours
- All of the disclosures fail to mention the foreclos​ure
- Apparently one of the seller's attorneys-- not the one he has handling the sale-- has been trying to mitigate the fo​reclosur​e with Chase Bank, whatever that means. I guess they're trying to reach an agreement where he'd be allowed to sell it to us-- is that a thing?

We currently rent and have a lengthy lease remaining ahead of us, so we don't have to move anytime soon, but we were really excited about the house. We even bought thousands of dollars' worth of DIY tools and supplies to fix up the place ahead of closing so that we would be ready to get started right away-- we were so close that we didn't think anything quite as bad as this would happen, but I now see it was unwise. We're now surrounded by boxes with nowhere to go.

We've been asking what our recourse is, but we don't know whom to trust, because our attorney and realtor have a vested interest in us not backing out of the sale (they both get paid at closing). They keep telling us not to worry, let's just wait and see, blah blah blah. We've made it clear that we have one foot out the door at this point. We've had bad feelings about the seller from the get-go. However, we also aren't eager to re-enter the rat-race of the housing market once the stay-at-home orders lift. The house is generally in good shape and the inspection failures were minor. We would be happy to move forward if it didn't have a for​eclo​sure.

We feel cheated and angry. While the price we got for the house is arguably good, we also worry that the history of fo​reclosure will negatively impact the resale value of the house. We purposely avoided buying any forec​losed homes in our search, and likely would not have placed an offer in the first place had we known (or would have placed a much lower one). In order words, this information would have materially changed our decision. Now _we_ feel inclined to not do the _seller_ ""any favors."" How did the selling party think this would go, honestly?

Can we add an addendum to the contract lowering the purchase price another 5% and walk if he doesn't sign? Will our lender take issue with that? We're about ready to walk, anyway. If we don't buy the house, will he have to surrender it to the bank for auction? If that's the case, one would think we have leverage here. We certainly don't want to pay the same amount after the stress of this nonsense.

What are our options now, aside from walking or waiting? We have no clue what to do.

Thank you for reading.

Now this isn't a normal ""What are my options?"" post.  This particular case has some interesting things involved.

1) originally I was sent a spreadsheet of what it would cost to move in and there is a line item for $1400 as a ""Security Deposit"" and a $250 ""Non refundable deposit"" however the lease itself only mentions $250 deposit, which I've never had an apartment have one that low.

2) They say that the 1400 was applied to rent and noting it in the excel file was a ""Clerical Error"" and the lease trumps all.

3) The person who signed the lease on the company side was later arrested and is currently serving jail time for forgery and theft.

4) I thought that the deposits covered all ""normal usage"" and I can't imagine why it needed to be replaced, it was replaced 2 years ago when I moved in.

5) Part of the move out fees they are associating is two months worth of bills, because they back bill by two months?  Is that a normal thing?

Do I have a leg to stand on if this goes to court?  Should I get a lawyer?  If they offer to just call it a wash, should I take it, or should I fight for the full 1400?

,legaladvice,"**Background**: Three years ago my father passed and I was assigned to be personal representative (PR - I guess similar to executor?). A few months later, his wife (stepmother) also passed away. Stepmother had no assets, and they had no children together.

The estate consists largely of a single, unoccupied commercial property valued at around 200k and some vehicles valued at around 15k total. There are no liens or debts.

Stepmother's daughter demanded to liquidate the assets and receive $150k they are ""entitled"" of father's estate since it would have passed to the stepmother upon his death. Brother wants to start a business in the commercial property and at one point was even ready to go into business together with stepmother's daughter.

After several rounds of legal negotiations over about a year to try and evenly split the estate between father's children (2+me) and stepmother's daughter by signing over partial ownership of the building, I washed my hands of the whole thing and handed over PR responsibilities to my brother. 2 years later, the estate is still pending.

A few months later, his wife (stepmother) also passed away. Stepmother had no assets, and they had no children together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The estate consists largely of a single, unoccupied commercial property valued at around 200k and some vehicles valued at around 15k total. There are no liens or debts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepmother&amp;#39;s daughter demanded to liquidate the assets and receive $150k they are &amp;quot;entitled&amp;quot; of father&amp;#39;s estate since it would have passed to the stepmother upon his death.

,legaladvice,"Hello all, I am currently renting an apartment in California. 3 days ago, my idiot neighbor somehow let her apartment get flooded. We live in two-story apartments and the entire bottom floor of her apartment was covered in about 4-5” of water. She is a whole separate issue. She didn’t tell anyone for what is most likely hours and by the time I was notified, water had begun leaking into my apartment through our shared wall.

Long story short, the property management is working on getting things taken care of but told me it’s going to be at least 3-4 days before it’s back to normal, so the next 3-4+ days, these are my living conditions:

-I have no carpet/tile downstairs. It’s all concrete.

-My downstairs bathroom is completely gone (Toilet, Sink, cabinet fixtures, etc.)

-Laundry room is gone. Won’t be able to do any laundry whatsoever. 

-Big dehumidifier that has to run during this time to dry out the walls. It is somewhat noisy but not unbearable. 

-The real kicker is the walls. They had to cut two feet high out of the walls around the entire downstairs, including the shared wall with my neighbor. This now leaves an opening between our two apartments. I could crawl into their apartment if I wanted to. It’s not small openings. Basically now I have 0 privacy in the downstairs area. I live in a very hot town and now I’m pretty sure if I tried to run my AC, I would be cooling mine and their apartment. It’s gotten very hot at night and the though of no AC has me a little concerned. The last part to this is I have a dog that could easily get into her apartment if he wanted to. I’m not allowed to block the wall because it needs to dry. 

All in all, I understand I could have it much worse than I do, but it’s still pretty frustrating and there really isn’t a concrete timetable as to when it will be complete. Do I have a case to withhold/discount rent during these days I’m affected? They already made it clear it was “livable” and that I won’t be getting a room during this time.

We are a smaller anime convention located in Kentucky that gets about 4K\~ attendees per year, and are entirely run by volunteers.  From the board of directors, the president, all the way down to the volunteer who comes in for one day to monitor the viewing room, we are an entirely volunteer force.  Any profit from the year before us goes into paying off the rest of that year, and then pre-paying for as much as we can for the next year.  This includes the contract with our venue, programs, website upkeep, any little expense that goes into planning a medium-ish sized event.  One of the attractions at the event is our Exhibitor Hall, where attendees can go to buy art, figures, wall scrolls, and general nerdy memorabilia.   For this, I write the contract, outline the space, review portfolio submissions, vet outside vendors and companies for sponsorship, and run the annual charity auction.

Because of Covid-19 we have made a difficult decision to postpone our event until the summer of 2021.  This event was approved by our host city, and was made with the general safety of our crew and attendees in mind.  Con plague is real, if you ever go to one, wash your hands.  Anyways, I was sending emails to all of the artists and vendors who have registered for the 2020 year, paid their table fees (some have fees upwards of 2 grand USD) and letting them know our plan.  We have told them that any tables purchased for 2020 have automatically been locked in as approved and paid for when our event resumes.  Anyone who would like is welcome to privately sell their table to another vendor as long as we are able to get that vendors information.  A long time vendor emailed be back that this was not an acceptable response and hinted at taking ""legal action"" if we do not offer them a refund immediately.

Our contract for vendors specifically states in the Refund Policy that any refund cannot be given out until that years event has concluded.

I am not sure what the legal outcome of this possibly is. The convention plain and simple does not have the 2K odd dollars to issue this vendor a refund.  Its all tied up into other contracts, and none of the members of the staff are exactly able to shell one out since we are also tied up with Covid money problems, on top of the fact that most of us are college students doing this as a way to give back to our community.  The only other thing I could think of would be selling off convention assets, but most of the things we own (IE TVs and systems for the video game room, AV equipment, etc) are all personal items from the staff.  If we were brought to court, between lawyer fees and having to break contracts with the other facilities that we are tied to (that might also result in other fees for the convention) our event would likely cease to exist for forever, putting a lot of us in trouble financially.

Basically, what I am asking is that... is there a way for the vendor to actually sue us and win?  I would love to refund them if I could, they have been a business relationship with us for a long time (10+ years) but we simply dont have the money.  And if we issue them a refund, it creates a domino effect to the tune of about 20 grand.  I am not a lawyer by any stretch of the imagination, like, I have an art degree for goodness sakes.

,legaladvice,"Okay so this is my very very first post here ... and it's a doozy.

I took my car to Oil Changers in Kingston, Ontario on April 16th, 2020 to get an oil change. They showed me the dip stick (which was full) so I thanked them all and drove away. Did a few errands on the way home and all seemed normal ......

... until 7 hours later.

&amp;#x200B;

I started my car and noticed that the oil light came on. That had never happened before in the 4 years I've owned the vehicle.  I drove a total of 10 kilometers to the gas station and along the way, the car was making noises. As I was turning in to the gas station, the car almost stalled out. Parked it and tried to start it, wouldn't turn over. A few more times, same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I called my boss who met me at the gas station to let me know that ALL of my oil had come out and that there was NO OIL FILTER. So he drove me home and low and behold, the filter was directly on the ground in an EXXON VALDEZ of oil in my parking spot. Took pictures of the whole thing, and tried to put the filter in upon returning, but it came off the car again and all the newly bought oil washed aground yet again.  Upon inspection of the oil filter, the seal had not be oiled at all, it was bone dry, the wrong size.

Started to hear noises recently and had inquired to my mechanic about it today being May 7th, 2020. Upon inspection, because of the lack of oil in the car, the engine has been damaged. I can't drive on major highways because of possible engine explosion should the RPM'S exceed a certain point. 

I need my car for work as I'm a delivery driver. I met with Oil Changers today and said I was starting a procedure with head office. My car is a 2009 Toyota Yaris.

&lt;p&gt;I took my car to Oil Changers in Kingston, Ontario on April 16th, 2020 to get an oil change. They showed me the dip stick (which was full) so I thanked them all and drove away. Did a few errands on the way home and all seemed normal ......&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... until 7 hours later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my car and noticed that the oil light came on. That had never happened before in the 4 years I&amp;#39;ve owned the vehicle.  I drove a total of 10 kilometers to the gas station and along the way, the car was making noises. As I was turning in to the gas station, the car almost stalled out. Parked it and tried to start it, wouldn&amp;#39;t turn over. A few more times, same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called my boss who met me at the gas station to let me know that ALL of my oil had come out and that there was NO OIL FILTER. So he drove me home and low and behold, the filter was directly on the ground in an EXXON VALDEZ of oil in my parking spot. Took pictures of the whole thing, and tried to put the filter in upon returning, but it came off the car again and all the newly bought oil washed aground yet again.  Upon inspection of the oil filter, the seal had not be oiled at all, it was bone dry, the wrong size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started to hear noises recently and had inquired to my mechanic about it today being May 7th, 2020. Upon inspection, because of the lack of oil in the car, the engine has been damaged. I can&amp;#39;t drive on major highways because of possible engine explosion should the RPM&amp;#39;S exceed a certain point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need my car for work as I&amp;#39;m a delivery driver. I met with Oil Changers today and said I was starting a procedure with head office. My car is a 2009 Toyota Yaris.&lt;/p&gt;

So my ex and I have a kid and for reasons that are not important for this post the school district wanted to expel the child claiming fraudulent enrollment.  We decided to hire a lawyer to appeal and present additional information to support our case with the unwritten understanding that we would split the bill.

We split the $1,500.00 retainer and the second bill they sent us was for $1,300 and as soon as I got my copy (they sent each of us a copy) I gave my ex a $700.00 check to her name with “Lawyer’s fees” (same as with the retainer check).

We won the case and last week we got the last bill for $1,650.00, including $1,300.00 from the previous bill.  I called the lawyer’s office and they confirmed that they did not receive payment for the second bill they sent.

I’ve been emailing my ex asking if she paid the bill and she has not responded.  This bothers me to no end because this law firm did an excellent, professional job for our child.

I was talking to my 89 year old grandpa and he suspects an employee at his bank emptying his safety deposit box.  
He keeps record and notes of EVERYTHING.  He has over $32,000 in gold coins he purchased and has receipts for that he put in a safety deposit box.  There was a banker at his bank that often helped him with things like paying bills and setting up his deposit box- this guy knew what was in the box.  One day my grandpa went to talk to him and learned the guy no longer worked there.  Shortly after, he took his key to the bank and it no longer worked for his box and they told him his box had been closed.  This was a few years ago now. He didn't report it because he didn't feel he had proof to prove his suspicions of that banker.  
Anything that can and should be done at this point??

Young and very naive about how credit works, I signed.

He then took back an Altima I bought from him in cash (no payments, I wasn’t ready), leaving me with the ultimatum of either taking on this $420+ monthly car payment (plus $150 for full coverage) or having a repo on my credit for 7 years. I, a college student at the time, freshly moved out and on my own, stepped up and took on the car payments. It instantly doubled my bills, but I managed. Its been five years and the car is now nearly paid off. I only owe $2700 on it! I’ve replaced the engine, transmission, and done all maintenance on it. By my understanding it’s my car. However, this morning I got an email from my moms ex-husband telling me he’d be coming to pick it up. No warning, and not a threat, a promise. 

Can he do this?! It’s my car. Isn’t that stealing? I know we co-signed on it, but I’ve been making payments on it and have put thousands of dollars of maintenance into it. 

I’m also starting school again in July. I’ve been working furiously to pay the car off before I no longer have an income, and could do it now if I needed to but it would drain my savings. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. I’m scared, way too ignorant in legal matters, and the last time I asked police for advice they said there was nothing they could do. If anyone could point me in the right direction or even tell me what to do, I can handle the rest. I’m a smart woman, but I’ve been manipulated by the people closest to me all my life, I thought maybe asking strangers for advice would be worth a shot.

Due to an accident I had to have root canals on both my front teeth. They didn't do them, but they did the crowns for them. They kinda forced me into doing them before I was ready and didn't explain anything about the process. I had a panic attack in the chair and they weren't empathetic at all. I have had nothing but trouble with my two front teeth. They kept falling out. They said I wasn't allowed to bite into anything and that I had to ""Princess eat."" Thing is I cut out things that I had to bite into and always broke down my food into smaller pieces and they still kept falling out. Before my first date with my now husband, during work, two days before my wedding... They would always fix it, but blame me every time. They're also cracked and they disregarded my concern and didn't fix them when I asked them to. They did a couple other root canals and there was always a problem. The last one they did it took 3 months to get the permanent in and I was there almost every week because the temporary kept falling out. ( Btw, the permanent fell out again tonight while eating bread) After the first year of being with this office, I tried everything to find a different dentist in the area but all my inquires led back to them. 

I went back to my old dentist as soon as my insurance changed and when I had my consultation he couldn't believe what had happened to my mouth in 5 years. He said all of my crowns didn't fit right and were loose. He said (and pictures showed) the backs of my front teeth were completely worn down by my bottom teeth because the bite wasn't right. When I told him about being told to ""princess eat"" he didn't know what that meant. He told me my crowns should be as tough as my real teeth, that there should be no restrictions on eating with them and it's never a patients fault when something goes wrong. I will gladly do whatever it takes to have him fix them.

I live in Texas. Iv rented a few apartments in the past with no problem. No huge issues anyway.

My questions are, how can she guarantee a unit for that move out date. Should I pay those fees without a having signed a lease there yet? And is this even right? This has never happened to me before but also they're reason for staying is because of the pandemic.
So I understand that. But how do I know they won't do this again with a different apartment?

For context, my mom is a sandwich-maker/chef at a small cafe and she was just made aware of this by her manager who I will call Mai, in confidence. The justification was that since my mother was low-income, her boss didn't want to push her income past the level that would disqualify us from social benefits however her co-workers with the same position and situation (another chef is intentionally requesting shorter hours) got raises so it doesn't add up. My mom hasn't spoken to her boss about it yet because she's afraid her poor English will make matters worse so she wants me to speak to her (I used to work there part time as a cashier).

This cafe has also done another number of other shady things such as violating health laws since some of the workers don't always wear gloves, and underpaying (they payed my mother below min wage when she started). In particular Mai actively steals money by taking orders, not putting it through the register and pocketing the cash customers give her. It's something of an open secret as my mom and the other chefs will frequently not get tickets, while Mai tells them the orders verbally and tells them to make it anyway. This has been reported several times to the boss but we suspect that because Mai is the boss's cousin she's aware of this but chooses not to do anything about it. I'm also pretty certain Mai hates my mom and verbally and physically abuses her by calling her slow, incompetent, fat etc. and punching her in the back while she's working. Mai also frequently steals things from lockers and my mom's purse such as money, lotions, makeup, gloves etc. That's also why I'm somewhat suspicious about why Mai of all people told her this information and not the boss. My mother is at the point of suing Mai and she's been playing dumb at work so she can get evidence of harassment and the orders without tickets. However, I want to know what we can do with this evidence

Again I will be the one asking the boss for more clarification so I would really like to be aware of some legal advice that may be helpful in this situation, and also what types of evidence I should look out for when speaking to her to figure out if my mom and I can sue them for this.

I won’t go into the child support aspect because it is a joke and I don’t think it’s relevant to the question at hand. 

We live in Illinois. Approximately 7 years ago, the company I work for wanted to relocate me to Michigan. My wife asked her husband if we could work something out and he said it would be fine.  Just so there would be no funny business down the road, we filed for a court date and my wife, her ex-husband, and me all went in-front of the judge.  After telling the judge why we were there, she seemed to be confused as to why we were there if all parties agreed.  She signed the ruling that said we would move to Michigan with our son. 

In the meantime, the company went into the tank and I got laid off. I found another job in Illinois but 1.5 hours away and we moved. That was just over 5 years ago.  Since we moved my wife’s ex-husband has attempted to be much more demanding and controlling. He believes he has a right to spend at least every other weekend with his son and even goes as far as to say he can take us to court and demand that we drive our son the 3 hour round trip every weekend so he can see him because we are the ones that moved away. I know he is blowing smoke and this would not happen but it does get to my wife at times. 

One time when her ex was making his threats, I discussed this with a family attorney (in a social setting not a consultation) and asked what “liberal” visitation mean. He told me that it means whatever my wife decides it means and that there would be nothing to do unless her ex files a suit. He told me that he has no legal authority to do anything the way the custody agreement is written. 

Now, an opportunity has presented itself that I might have the opportunity to transfer to Missouri. This transfer would be beneficial to both my family and my career. I am wanting to know what we need to do, if anything, legally.  Our son is 14 and if he had to go in-front of a judge, there is absolutely zero doubt that he would say he wanted to stay with his mom and I. He does not have the best relationship with his father and definitely feels like a pawn in some sort of game of control over his mother.

,legaladvice,"I'm in California (LA County,) and was in a pretty bad car accident on April 20th. There were 3 parties involved, but I haven't heard from a representative of the third party yet (I hope that I don't ever, but it could happen), only the second. (For ease of reading I'll say P2 and P3)

I won't go into the gruesome details, my car collided with P2's and then was pushed into P3's. P2 (driver and his father) were both taken to the hospital immediately. P3 and everyone in my vehicle weren't hospitalized. All 3 cars were towed away, mine was totaled. Both P2 and P3 have insurance (Progressive and State general respectively), but I have none, and I'm a 20/yo college student without a job (now that I don't have a car). I also don't have a license but I do have a learner's permit, and had a licensed driver with me in the car. (That should have stopped me from getting a VC 12500 citation, but there's another subreddit dedicated to fighting wrongful tickets.)

The police report has some flawed information, but the fact that i was at fault is true. I was contacted by P2's Personal Injury Lawyer yesterday, and she said she had received the report but then immediately asked me what kind of insurance I have. It states clearly on the report that I have none. I told her I couldn't talk right then. Why would she ask me to say it out loud if she already knew?

I'd hate to drag this all out if P2 just wants money for the hospital bills his insurance wouldn't give him or something, but I'm scared, I've never even been to court as an adult, and I highly doubt I could afford a private lawyer on TOP OF whatever money P2'll try to get out of me.

Reading up on it, the state of California *typically* doesn't allow people public defenders for personal injury cases. I have tried calling the public defender's office, but they don't allow you to seek consul of any sort until you've actually gone to court and been assigned a defender (your arraignment, I was told).  On top of this, everything in my county is closed, I'm pretty sure all California courts are as well, so I don't even know *when* we would go to court if they're really going to try to sue money out of me (I have half a stimulus check to last me the summer, if that tells you anything) I guess my questions are,

1. Should I keep trying to find free consul somehow, before I say anything to this lawyer?
2. Is she even allowed to call me again if I told her I'd call her back?
3. If I don't have a court date even set yet, would hiring a private lawyer in this type of case cost thousands? (like I said, no income.. half a stim check in my savings.)

Hey so I’m not sure if this is the place for something like this and if not could you please direct me to a sub where this would be better suited? Anyway I’ll start with a little background: several months ago my dad met this guy who’s supposedly a millionaire from Florida. Now my dad is a super friendly Christian guy so he believes in helping people out regardless of circumstances. Anyway this guy was divorced and was in Minnesota for a reason I can’t quite remember, but long story short he ended up staying at our house once. My dad and this friend continued talking and my dads lent him money over time for various reasons. The guy constantly promises to pay my dad back “on Monday” or “next week” or “soon” but never does.

Anyway I’ll start with a little background: several months ago my dad met this guy who’s supposedly a millionaire from Florida. Now my dad is a super friendly Christian guy so he believes in helping people out regardless of circumstances. Anyway this guy was divorced and was in Minnesota for a reason I can’t quite remember, but long story short he ended up staying at our house once. My dad and this friend continued talking and my dads lent him money over time for various reasons. The guy constantly promises to pay my dad back “on Monday” or “next week” or “soon” but never does.

**TLDR**:

&amp;#x200B;

Employer, SmallCo, provided a HDHP Anthem plan. Anthem made my life a living hell and affected my job performance, leading me to get fired.

&amp;#x200B;

SmallCo was informed of the issues as soon as issues with Anthem began and SmallCo got me in touch with their broker's ""consumer advocate"" who did nothing except making me sign a few forms saying I would not sue them (broker) but enter into an arbitration.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I HAD to call Anthem, doctors and labs during business hours (that's the only time they were open) it affected my job performance.

&amp;#x200B;

After I was fired for poor performance, I still, to this date, have to settle bills and collections from doctors and labs as I look for a job and Anthem is not cooperating at all. No returned calls or emails.

&amp;#x200B;

HR at SmallCo says they won't do anything and recommended I sue Anthem, wishing me good luck and indirectly telling me to never call them again.

&amp;#x200B;

*What kind of attorneys do I reach out to to help me with this? I had to go to the hospital twice already due to severe sleep deprivation attacks*

&amp;#x200B;

**Details**:

&amp;#x200B;

Employer, SmallCo, provided a HDHP Anthem plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Being HDHP I have to pay the first $5k out of my own pocket. Since my husband's sick, I met that real quick in Feb 2020 since I had to go to a dozen doctors and labs after he started to have seizures.

&amp;#x200B;

On March 2020, Anthem sent me a letter stating they would reject all of my 53 claims because they were not my primary insurance and that I had ""other"" coverage.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been with SmallCo for 5 years and Anthem is the only coverage outside a liability only auto policy that I ever had in my life. My husband cannot work and never has, so no insurance policy exists.

&amp;#x200B;

Anthem refused to tell me what that ""other"" coverage is and after 45 days of constant back and forth, emails, phone calls they agreed to reprocess my claims.

&amp;#x200B;

Only thing, they now processed my claims in a different order than the original order.

&amp;#x200B;

This required me to settle invoices with a separate set of doctors and labs and follow up on refunds from previous set of doctors and labs - pure hell and purgatory. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since we had to go to a large number of doctors and labs, this was a lot of phone calls and visits. Hundreds of calls, emails, faxes.

&amp;#x200B;

It affected my job performance - I explained this to my manager as soon as this began, who proceeded to put me on probation a week after I told him.

&amp;#x200B;

A month later I was fired for poor performance.

&amp;#x200B;

SmallCo paid me 2 weeks of severance for my troubles with Anthem and made me sign a release form that I would not say bad things on twitter etc (previous employees had bad mouthed SmallCo).

&amp;#x200B;

However, I still have to settle bills and collections from doctors and labs as I look for a job and Anthem is not cooperating at all.

&amp;#x200B;

They did not want to mess with the W-2 paperwork so they offered to reimburse me the difference of taxes that I paid and what was reported. I was okay with this so I agreed to it. I have all of this in writing. It&amp;#39;s now May and I haven&amp;#39;t received anything from them. The owner is ignoring my texts, calls, and emails. What are my options? Should I report them to the NJ DOL or the IRS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: If I do go the DOL and IRS route, should I mention the tax difference reimbursement? I&amp;#39;m not sure how legal this is. My understanding is that not all of my tax deductions actually went to the government and my employer kept the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

On Wednesday, he came into work to find a sealed envelope addressed to him. Inside was a [letter](https://i.imgur.com/7tx0Rfq.jpg) stating that a coworker of his has tested positive for COVID-19. These letters were only given to other employees that have worked closely with the employee in the last 48 hours. Not every employee knows about the positive case, but it's slowly getting around by word of mouth. It's been confirmed that one of the employee's family members has also tested positive. This person has not been at work since Tuesday.

Other than these letters, the store is not doing anything else. I only know of this because my brother works there. The public does not know about the infected employee. I called the store director and asked what was going to be done, whether the employees that came within contact with her needed to stay home and be tested, or if the store would be shut down to be cleaned. He said they are following the CDC guidelines, and it does not call for any of that to happen. They aren't changing their hours, still working normal times from before the lockdown.

Although the invoice I received clearly reads ""rent service fee"". I asked if this could be avoided by using in person payments/paper checks and they said no. I feel like this is not valid, but don't want to be a PITA. 

The online payment section makes no note of convenience fees. Here is the section on online payments:  

&gt;**4.2. Online Payments.** Residents are permitted to make rent payments via an online web-based service. Payment of rent online, while such service is provided by Owner, is for Residents' convenience - the risk of receipt of funds by Owner when such service is used is Residents', and not Owner's, risk. Furthermore, Residents hereby agree not to chargeback any rent payments made by credit card, debit card, EFT, ACH or any other electronic means to Owner. Owner and Residents agree that when Residents chargeback rent payments in such a manner, the actual cost to Owner is difficult or impossible to ascertain, but the Parties agree that Owner does, in the event of such chargebacks, incur certain costs, such as additional bookkeeping and administrative charges, bank charges, lost opportunity costs of the chargeback payment. After making a reasonable endeavor to estimate accurately the approximate costs associated with such a breach, which the Parties agree is difficult or impossible to ascertain, the Parties agree that, any time Residents chargeback a payment made by electronic means, Residents shall pay Owner a sum of $0.00 for the chargeback, as stipulated liquidated damages, as both Residents and Owner hereby agree that the amount of damages Owner will be forced to endure in the event of such a chargeback. In the event of such a chargeback, Residents shall pay the rent, liquidated damages and any other applicable charges and fees then due by certified check or money order. If one (1) or more payments submitted by Residents are charged back in any twelve (12) month period, Residents shall be required to pay all future rent and other charges by certified check or money order. Owner shall not require any form of electronic funds transfer to be the only form of payment.   
&gt;  
&gt;**5. LATE PAYMENTS AND FEES.** Owner and Residents agree that it is and will be impracticable and extremely difficult to fix the actual damages suffered by Owner in the event Residents make a late payment of rent, or when Residents make a payment that is subsequently dishonored by the bank, but the Parties agree that Owner does, in the event of late payment or in the event of a dishonored check, incur certain costs, such as additional bookkeeping and administrative charges, bank charges, lost opportunity costs of the late payment. After making a reasonable endeavor to estimate accurately the approximate costs associated with such a breach, the Parties agree that the below charges represent a reasonable approximation of the damages Owner is likely to suffer from a late or dishonored payment. Owner and Residents further agree that this provision does not establish a grace period of the payment of rent, and that Owner may give Residents a written notice to pay or quit the Leased Premises in accordance with State law at any time after the payment is due. Owner shall have all remedies under the law and this Agreement in the event Resident fails to timely pay the rent or other amounts owed. At Owner's sole discretion, Owner may report any delinquent rent or other amounts owed to a credit reporting agency.

They pointed to the utilities section as the one allowing the charge, see below. They also told me to contact them, but I didn't sign any paperwork with this third party, the lease is with my leasing office.

...

&gt;**11. UTILITIES.** Unless the following is modified by a separate addendum to this Agreement, Owner agrees, at Owner's expense, to furnish the following utilities to the Leased Premises: None. Residents agree to pay all charges (including utility deposits) not supplied by Owner, assessed by the utility provider or Owner, or Owner's designated Billing Party in connection with Residents' use of utilities during the term of this Agreement, or the period of occupancy by Residents, whichever is longer. During the term or any renewal period of this Agreement, Residents shall not allow utilities to be disconnected - and shall pay all utility bills on time. Residents shall not waste utilities supplied by Owner. Residents shall properly use all electrical, gas and plumbing fixtures and appliances. Residents shall not install or operate any additional equipment or appliance including but not limited to additional refrigerators and freezers, a dishwasher, washing machine, clothes dryer or an air conditioning unit in the Leased Premises unless supplied by Owner or with Owner's prior written approval. Residents will be responsible for the following utilities: Electric, Gas, Water, Sewer, and Trash.

She stopped right when she saw him taking left. But within seconds he banged into the car and broke headlight, and a ripped off that piece above front tyre and front bumper. I got out the car and straight up a stranger comes from the opposite side of the road saying it was my gf’s fault. He says she parked the car where it was a no stopping zone. I was in the car as well and i think she only slowed down. Also i could see the stranger guy going to the truck driver and saying i can be your proof of evidence and i’ll say it was her fault. I only have third party insurance and its not on her name as its my car. Please help me figure out if its worthy trying to file a case or the best thing to do&lt;/p&gt;

So I've been renting a room in a 5 bedroom apartment for 3 months so far. When the quarantine started all the other house mates have left and I've been the only one here since. I've just discovered that the landlord has the apartment listed on Booking.com as a short term room rental. 

Where do I stand here legally? I'm renting a room which states in the contract that I'm responsible for the shared areas. I had noticed before we had people move in and leave days later and now it makes sense. 

I'm worried because if someone books one of these rooms, I have belongings here, food in the fridge etc as I live here and these people would be treating the place like a hotel.

Hello, I don’t really know where to start or what to do but here goes nothing.

I used to work at a topless/bottomless shop where it’s kind of like a topless bar but we don’t serve alcohol. We’re all of legal age. There is no filming or photography allowed of any kind for our privacy. 

Recently, I got a message saying there’s a video spreading of me and a former coworker of mine on a porn site and so we tried to get the video down as fast as possible. Unfortunately, this video was taken roughly a year ago and we don’t know who took and posted the video. 

We’ve tried to find as many sources for the video as possible but they just keep popping up from porn sites to twitter to reddit, they just keep appearing but that’s just how the internet works. The post on reddit had people actually identifying the place and just the comments were just soul crushing. I messaged the mods and reported the post but I don’t know if I can keep up with constantly having to browse and find this video. 

The person who first notified us about the video said his cousin from Mexico got it from WhatsApp and I guess it’s been circulating there for a while now. We’re from the US so it’s just distressing seeing everyone who’s posted the video is from a different location. 

Since we have no idea who filmed it and posted it, is there anything we can do? 

We’ve gathered account info on the users reuploading the video but it seems so hopeless that anything will make this situation better. 

Would contacting a lawyer be any help? 

My old employer was not the most law abiding citizen like the security cameras didn’t actually record and that we’re concerned they didn’t get proper permits for allowing us to be topless so we’re scared we might end up being the ones punished for getting help in this situation.  Maybe this post is just a projection of my frustration but I just don’t know what to do or who to seek for help.

 My elderly aunt lives in/owns a house (she has paid it off)that her two also aging siblings live with her. They have  no contracts or renters agreements and to my knowledge do not pay rent or contribute much beyond buying groceries and some light housework (barely). My aunt has rapidly advancing Parkinson's and is mostly housebound due to the pandemic and that she has trouble walking even with a walker. One sibling, sibling A, has lived there for over a decade and he is kind of a mess, perhaps an alcoholic or has some anger management issues. He has a job. The other sibling, sibling B,  moved up here a couple  years ago and never found employment, she is very stubborn. 

Sibling B helps out a bit with my aunt's home care needs but isn't very nice to her and often thinks that my aunt should just be able to do it herself. Sibling A only does things when asked and only if he is in a ""good"" mood. 

My elderly mother goes over to this house daily to help my aunt shower and get dressed and make sure her needs are met.
 
Sibling B refuses to wear a mask and doesn't believe.in the coronavirus. I don't know if she practices social distancing or hand washing even when she goes out. She is putting the health of my aunt and my mom at great risk. No amount of begging, asking will change her mind. 

Sibling A got angry at my mother last week when she asked him to help with something. He physically pushed her! She was scared.

Basically my mother can no longer go over there and help my aunt out with these new developments. My aunt doesn't really want these siblings to live there anymore but she is scared and sad and not sure what to do. She doesn't have a lot of money beyond social security.

How can my aunt legally get these two out of her house in the least painful way possible? What if she needs to sell her house and move into a assisted living home? What can I do to help protect her interests? My mom has signed some papers recently that put her in charge of some of my aunt's will I believe also, but I'm not sure what exactly.

,legaladvice,"Hi LegalAdvice

My case is not complicated at all, but it's very frustrating, and unfair. I need assistance to get in contact with somebody who can help me with legal advise to correct a hospital bill.

I went to the Urgent Care section at Hospital in Texas in regular urgent care hours. The receptionist, the nurse, and the doctor, they all assured me that my visit was an urgent care visit and not an emergency.

I recently received my bill, and I am being charged that I was in the emergency room, clearly they used a wrong code to bill me. I called the number on the back of the bill and the billing rep said that the Urgent Care is an ""extension"" of the Emergency Room, and there is no way to correct my bill because there is no an ""Urgent Care"" bill code at the hospital. This is unbelievable. Clearly on the front of the building says ""Urgent Care"". I know that the emergency room is next to the Urgent Care, but I was never moved to that location, and nurses assured me of that.

After so many calls and hours of frustration, they refused to negotiate for a discount even in this hard times and pandemic. I escalated it to different people, and they even refuse to negotiate/discount because I used insurance (note: at the time of services, I didn't met my deductible). Clearly, I'm being punished for using my insurance. I'm completely stuck in this unfair system, no urgent care billing code, and no discount because I used insurance.

I know that I have very limited options and the legal option is my last one. They cannot charge me like that and my insurance doesn't support TDI mediation, and they told me that the hospital needs to fix the billing code.

I noticed that I'm not alone in this and there are people complaining about the exact situation. There are negative google reviews about this scheme against the hospital. The hospital definitely is taking advantage of this situation.

I'm not sure if it will cost more money to contact a lawyer but at this point is important to fight this bill. I will appreciate if you can point me to the right direction.

&lt;p&gt;My case is not complicated at all, but it&amp;#39;s very frustrating, and unfair. I need assistance to get in contact with somebody who can help me with legal advise to correct a hospital bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the Urgent Care section at Hospital in Texas in regular urgent care hours. The receptionist, the nurse, and the doctor, they all assured me that my visit was an urgent care visit and not an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently received my bill, and I am being charged that I was in the emergency room, clearly they used a wrong code to bill me. I called the number on the back of the bill and the billing rep said that the Urgent Care is an &amp;quot;extension&amp;quot; of the Emergency Room, and there is no way to correct my bill because there is no an &amp;quot;Urgent Care&amp;quot; bill code at the hospital. This is unbelievable. Clearly on the front of the building says &amp;quot;Urgent Care&amp;quot;. I know that the emergency room is next to the Urgent Care, but I was never moved to that location, and nurses assured me of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After so many calls and hours of frustration, they refused to negotiate for a discount even in this hard times and pandemic. I escalated it to different people, and they even refuse to negotiate/discount because I used insurance (note: at the time of services, I didn&amp;#39;t met my deductible). Clearly, I&amp;#39;m being punished for using my insurance. I&amp;#39;m completely stuck in this unfair system, no urgent care billing code, and no discount because I used insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

1. I’m posting this on behalf of a friend who has no reddit account.

2. No, I am not my friend.

3. The political team in question will not be defined since it strikes me that any political team harassing someone should have all the same laws applied equally.

4. For the love of all things sacred and not, let’s leave political agendas out of this , see number 3.  

5. My friend lives in the state of Washington if that helps clarify things at all.

OK got that outta the way.

Basically, the situation is this: My friend is very poor and on government assistance. This means he has a phone provided by the government for emergencies and basic communication. Nope this is not an iPhone, it’s a flip-phone; it can take/ make call, text, and handle voicemail, that’s pretty-much it. For some time now my friend has been getting calls from a particular political party (again not going to say which). These calls are in the form of a pre-recorded message asking my friend (or anyone who happens to answer) to support their candidate. More recently these calls have morphed into the pre-recorded question “This is (so-and-so) from (political party) aren’t you going to support (their candidate)?” Keep in mind that as far as my friend can tell, there is not opt-out or no-call option for this sort of message. These calls started out once daily, now they seem to run on a strange kind of calling schedule. For example: nothing Sunday or Monday, 3 calls Tuesday, nothing Wednesday or Thursday, 2 calls Friday. I’m not clear on whether the calls are on weekends as well. My friend has tried to block the calls but they come from a different number overtime. This strikes me as a red flag; I mean if it’s from a real political party, why keep changing numbers?.

Since I know this question will come up I’m going to address it now: Why doesn’t my friend just select the option to support this candidate? Well, my friend is vehemently opposed to this candidate, and as such refuses to support that person in any way. In my estimation, my friend has a point, they should not have to show any support for a political candidate even just to stop harassing phone calls..

So on behalf of my friend the questions are these:

1. Is this legally regarded as harassment?

2. Could this possibly be some sort of scam?

3. How would he go about stopping this nonsense?

4. Because political free speech is put on a pedestal is a political group exempt from laws regarding harassment via phone?

,legaladvice,"Hey, I had a situation come up and was told I could potentially get some advice here!

Recently, I was informed that I was exposed to someone who has Covid. After finding out, being polite I immediately told my roommates. They requested that I move out for 2 weeks to quarantine. I moved out as they requested. I got tested for Covid and was negative. My roommates talked to my landlord requesting me to be kicked out. I received and eviction notice “because I was exposed to covid and wasn’t getting along with the roommates” and was advised to move out by May 21st. I called my landlord to have a conversation with her but all she said was “you’re out” and hung up the phone. 

Now I am trying to get my things and just move in with my parents until I figure out where to live, but my roommates are not speaking to me even though I have attempted to contact them. Which is making the move out difficult.

My understanding was that it was illegal to evict anyone during covid as well as I feel as if this discrimination.

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was informed that I was exposed to someone who has Covid. After finding out, being polite I immediately told my roommates. They requested that I move out for 2 weeks to quarantine. I moved out as they requested. I got tested for Covid and was negative. My roommates talked to my landlord requesting me to be kicked out. I received and eviction notice “because I was exposed to covid and wasn’t getting along with the roommates” and was advised to move out by May 21st. I called my landlord to have a conversation with her but all she said was “you’re out” and hung up the phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am trying to get my things and just move in with my parents until I figure out where to live, but my roommates are not speaking to me even though I have attempted to contact them. Which is making the move out difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My understanding was that it was illegal to evict anyone during covid as well as I feel as if this discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"[Florida] Today, a maintenance worker from my apartment complex came to fix a cabinet door with 0 notice. A work order for this was placed in early 2019, to which no response was given. We have had scheduled inspections twice since, at which time the damage was noted, but the most recent was on 4/21, and were told by the inspecting Property Manager that they would come the following day to make the repair. We agreed to this, but the repair never occurred. This is the most recent notice we have received, and have had no contact about it since the day of the inspection, in person. I have contacted management about this, but being after business hours, we have yet to receive a response. 

My question is twofold:

1) From my understanding of the relevant local law, “The landlord may enter the dwelling unit upon reasonable notice to the tenant and at a reasonable time for the purpose of repair of the premises. “Reasonable notice” for the purpose of repair is notice given at least 12 hours prior to the entry, and reasonable time for the purpose of repair shall be between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.” 

Am I incorrect in thinking that the notice I was provided was for a different date? I feel like that would allow notice to exist indefinitely, allowing entry at any time, but IANAL.

2) Having not heard back from them, I’m not sure what to expect. They have always been professional and amicable, and I think it was likely due to a communication error between maintenance and management, but are there any red-flag responses that mean I need to seek legal help? 

Ultimately, I’m very inexperienced at dealing with landlords beyond simply paying the rent. I am not sure, but from what information I have been able to gather, it seems like this is illegal.

I called the restaurant and confirmed the purchase was made there, had them save the receipt, and they are seeing if the person (who got takeout) was on their video.

Earlier today BEFORE the charge popped up, I missed four close together calls from my bank.

Based in PA, but I will be traveling to other states for work, including FL, NY, NJ, NC, and SC. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"Not quite two years ago, I was in the process of moving my family out of the country as I was taking a job overseas. I was already in Europe setting up our residence there, but my wife and son were still in California preparing to move. My father-in-law came to town to help her pack up our belongings, and used our (leased) car to go pick up some food. While driving, he made a u-turn and was broadsided by a woman going the opposite direction. We notified our insurance (Progressive) and he was found at fault, but was not ticketed by police at the scene and there were no injuries. Because I was in Europe at the time, I wasn't super involved with the process other than approving a shop where Progressive had the damage appraised - our car was eventually deemed a total loss, and the insurance company paid off our lease. Didn’t hear about the other driver, other than my insurance notifying me that her lawyer was requesting to know my policy’s coverage limits.

Now, just under the two-year statute of limitations since the date of the accident, my FIL has informed me he was just served lawsuit papers at his home in Texas, sent by a lawyer here in California representing the woman who was driving the other car. Claims of injury, loss of income, personal suffering, etc. No monetary amount is indicated, other than it being more than the $25,000 threshold. FIL has his own insurance, through USAA, but I’m not sure if they were notified of the original accident or not. My family and I are back in California now and still have insurance through Progressive. I have not been served papers, though my insurance did let me know that the claim the other driver originally filed was still open as of a month ago (I was calling about another matter and my agent informed me).

My question is: should I notify Progressive that my FIL has been served a lawsuit related to the accident? Or should my FIL notify USAA? Or both? And should I be expecting a lawsuit as well?

I contacted Grumpy Cat's lawyer (Hughes, Socol, Piers, Resnick &amp; Dym, Ltd) they're asking for $1,500 settlement. I googled this lawyer's office name, apparently, they are known for ""copyrights troll""?  They are suing thousands of people for Grumpy Cat. What should I do?

We've lived here for about 15 years, our downstairs neighbor moved in a few months ago, and since then we've been receiving ""three day notice to perform covenant or quit"" notices on our door with the instruction to stop smoking in our unit, it's making the guy downstairs have asthma problems.

We have not smoked once. 

Not once. No incense, no candles, not even smoke from cooking.  But apparently, downstairs neighbor has called and complained to the landlord (but never talked to us) that we keep smoking and it's coming in through his bathroom fan. (which would be directly below ours, so he assumes that we are smoking in the bathroom to hide it and that air and smoke now travel downward).  And the landlord keeps believing, never comes over to check (no one else can see or smell smoke!), and keeps telling us that ""He's going to sue us and you"" and ""he had to get a second inhaler"" and ""his doctor says he could have a heart attack"".  And so we keep getting notices and very unfriendly calls from our landlord to 'stop smoking!!' And all we can say is 'we're not!!"".

a) isn't a 'he said-she said' a situation where there wouldn't be other witnesses or evidence besides the two parties? In this case, our 'smoking' would be totally verifiable. Couldn't you just come up and smell or ask anyone in the equally close apt. units if they've ever smelled anything?

She didn't seem to understand the logic that if I was doing that all the time, there would be no reason for me to also smoke in the bathroom and jeopardize my housing.

Hello, I'll keep this direct and to the point.

A few weeks ago (I work in food service) I worked at a restaurant on March 28th all night. On March 29th I began to feel feverish and got an appointment to urgent care. I was tested, and let my employer know that I was showing symptoms of COVID-19 and was tested that evening - the results would take up to a week and I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to work and exposing co-workers/customers until I knew the results. He said no problem and to keep him updated.

Two days later my family and I were all confirmed positive for COVID-19. I immediately notified my employer to let him know this, and that the health department in my county would be routinely checking up on me, but to expect that I would be out a minimum of 10-14 days before I would be allowed to leave self-quarantine per the County Health Department. Again I was told no problem and to get better.  

I contact my employer after i'm released from self-isolation and ask when i can come back to work and get no response. nothing and get no response for the next m We're now into May and after a few messages with the owner who initially said ""No problem we'd love to have you back"", is now saying that the staff and ownership is scared of working with me and that ""we'll see"" when I can come back (which I have no vacation/sick time so this is essentially being unemployed without any formal notice) since I was sick and then 0 communication.

I know as an American my rights are extremely limited but is there anything I can do in this situation? The job market is horrible right now and I don't have many options.

Jump to 1.5 years later, Boss decides that it would be a good idea for me to go on EI, to save the company some money because of COVID-19, but not to worry, because I'll be rehired when work comes back, and in order to do so he releases my ROE (Record of Employment).

On that document it shows my hours correctly, but it undervalues my earnings and says that I was paid for Vacation hours that I neither took, nor were paid out for.

At this time, our small company uses a 3rd party company for payroll, and as employees we are ok not receiving paystubs, because, basically it's a mom and pop shop, without the mom.  So small, it should be just a pop shop, and we trust each other, 'cause it's a small team, never really worried about pay stubs before.

However, Boss decides, now he's not going to re-hire me, and he's going to hire someone for cheaper.  
So I decide to do some digging, and formally request my pay stubs.

I currently live in a condominium building in NYC, and my lease is over May 31st. I rent from a private owner and have recently discovered that the building is not allowing any private businesses inside for the foreseeable future due to COVID-19, which means that I can't have movers come into the building. They'll allow me to take out my stuff by myself, but for large furniture (like my couch and bed) they require a Certificate of Insurance in case of damages incurred to the building during the move-out. Is there a way for me to get Certificate of Insurance for myself? 

The building management company tells me I have to take it up with the owner of the unit. I don't think it's reasonable for them to expect me to leave my furniture here and pay for rent or renew my lease. Is the building legally allowed to refuse me the use of the elevator to get my furniture out?

,legaladvice,"My (37F) soon to be ex-husband (38M) is not making this divorce as amicable as we originally had intended.

The basic state of things is that we've been married for 15 years and have a 12 year old daughter. We live in the state of Texas, currently own a home, and one vehicle. The home is still under mortgage while the vehicle is paid off.

I am legally disabled and receive SSDI monthly, while he is partially disabled and received VA benefits monthly while also being able to be employed. He is currently not working, as he was laid off in January.  We have one joint bank account as well as a savings account with his name on it and he has a secondary checking account that was his prior to our marriage that his VA benefits are deposited into. (I just realized that literally my name is only on one of these accounts and it is making me ill to my stomach.)

There are a multitude of reasons for this divorce - bad communication, emotional manipulation, general irreconcilable differences - but when I stated to him that this was the route I was going to take, he agreed to not fight me on it. My daughter being 12 stated that she was going to come with me, and begrudgingly agreed to visitation.

He is currently living with his mother out of state while I pack up the house and get it ready to sell. He states that he will be back at the end of the month, supposedly to pick up his things and put them in storage wherever. Everything was going as swimmingly as possible until we started texting this afternoon regarding discussion of splitting of the assets.

We had agreed previously that we would sell the home and split the profits. I agreed to give him the vehicle as I'll be moving in with my mother and we can share her vehicle. We then started discussing debt that we have and I agreed that we should take the money in the savings account and pay off what debt (credit cards and a loan of approx. 11K that we pulled from his 401K when I had to stop working and my disability had not yet been approved. (We also used my full 401K previously to cover bills and such until my disability was approved.) All seemed fine until we discussed his remaining 401K. I mentioned that in Texas his 401K, as it has all be accrued during the course of our marriage, is considered community property and we could just split it 50/50.

He blew UP.

I was on the phone trying to set an appointment to get his vehicle inspection done, and when I didn't pick up the phone, he resorted to calling my mother. Because I am discussing taking 50% of his 401K, he is threatening to go after any of my mom's accounts (checking, savings, her IRA, etc) that have my name on the account (so that in case of emergencies or death, I will have access) simply because my name is on the account. Is this even *possible?*  His reasoning is that if I'm going after 50% of *his* assets, he's going to go after 50% of mine.

,legaladvice,"The summary:

I purchased a house in Georgia last September that was not up to code, but the seller and I added an amendment to the purchase agreement stating, ""For a period of one year from closing, Sellers will make needed repairs required due to renovations to the house which do not meet County code for work performed.”  We agreed to do this because the house had back taxes on it and was going to a tax sale so the seller needed to close quickly.  I had the county inspect the house after closing, and they found many issues. I had contractors estimate the cost to repair these issues, and the estimates ranged from $4,632 to $5,757.  The seller and I are now communicating through my real estate agent. I asked the seller for the higher amount to cover any overages I might incur. He countered by offering me half of that, which will only cover part of the electrical repairs and none of the plumbing, HVAC or structural repairs. 
Do I have any legal options to fully enforce the amendment to the purchase agreement and have this resolved?  Do the seller's agent, title attorney, mortgage company or any of the professional parties involved in this deal hold any responsibility?


These are the details:

The house I purchased had recently been renovated. That builder took out a private loan for the purchase and renovation from a local real estate agent and developer for the work. The builder was unable to sell the property and ended up getting foreclosed upon by the lender. I then purchased the property from the lender, who was also the real estate agent selling the property.

A few days before closing I found out through my own research that none of the building permits for the work had been closed out, and a certificate of occupancy had not been issued. I discussed this with my real estate agent, and she talked to someone with the County who said that a certificate of occupancy was not required. I still did not feel comfortable with this, and the seller offered to add an amendment to the purchase agreement stating ""For a period of one year from closing, Sellers will make needed repairs required due to renovations to the house which do not meet County code for work performed.” 

This made me feel comfortable with moving ahead with closing, based on the verbal council that it was legal to occupy and on the amendment stating that it would be remedied after closing.

I contacted the County last October after living in the house for a month and had code inspectors come out to finish the inspections. They told me that my real estate agent was incorrect; it was illegal to occupy the home without a certificate of occupancy. They found many issues with the electrical work, a few with the plumbing, one with the HVAC, and one with the structure. I tried to work with them to find a solution, but they were just as confused as I was about how to proceed since they said they weren’t going to require me to move out of my home.

After consulting with a family friend who is in construction, and my real estate agent/her broker, I had the code inspectors come back out and fail the inspections. Then I obtained two estimates for the work that would be required to bring the renovations up to code. The low end of the estimates came to $4,632 and the high end was $5,757. I sent the failed code inspections and the estimates to the sellers asking that they bring the work up to code per our contract. The sellers responded through my real estate agent that they are too busy to have their people come out.  They asked if there was a financial solution that we could come to for me to get the work done. I told them that since work often goes over the estimated cost, I would like the payment of the higher estimates because they would not be billed directly for the actual cost of the work.

Today I received a response that they are willing to give me half of what I asked for, which does not even cover the lower estimate for electrical work that is required.  I find this completely unacceptable. The code inspectors and my family friend all seem to think that the seller's agent, title attorney, mortgage company and any of the professional parties in this deal should have not allowed the deal to close.",t2_qv2um,False,,0,False,Enforce purchase agreement to remedy code issues on a flipped house GA,[],r/legaladvice,False,6,,0,False,t3_gffw1w,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Real Estate law,False,1,,False,,1588888291.0,,[],{},,True,,1588916523.0,text,6,,,text,self.legaladvice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summary:&lt;/p&gt;

Do I have any legal options to fully enforce the amendment to the purchase agreement and have this resolved?  Do the seller&amp;#39;s agent, title attorney, mortgage company or any of the professional parties involved in this deal hold any responsibility?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house I purchased had recently been renovated. That builder took out a private loan for the purchase and renovation from a local real estate agent and developer for the work. The builder was unable to sell the property and ended up getting foreclosed upon by the lender. I then purchased the property from the lender, who was also the real estate agent selling the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days before closing I found out through my own research that none of the building permits for the work had been closed out, and a certificate of occupancy had not been issued. I discussed this with my real estate agent, and she talked to someone with the County who said that a certificate of occupancy was not required. I still did not feel comfortable with this, and the seller offered to add an amendment to the purchase agreement stating &amp;quot;For a period of one year from closing, Sellers will make needed repairs required due to renovations to the house which do not meet County code for work performed.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me feel comfortable with moving ahead with closing, based on the verbal council that it was legal to occupy and on the amendment stating that it would be remedied after closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contacted the County last October after living in the house for a month and had code inspectors come out to finish the inspections. They told me that my real estate agent was incorrect; it was illegal to occupy the home without a certificate of occupancy. They found many issues with the electrical work, a few with the plumbing, one with the HVAC, and one with the structure. I tried to work with them to find a solution, but they were just as confused as I was about how to proceed since they said they weren’t going to require me to move out of my home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After consulting with a family friend who is in construction, and my real estate agent/her broker, I had the code inspectors come back out and fail the inspections. Then I obtained two estimates for the work that would be required to bring the renovations up to code. The low end of the estimates came to $4,632 and the high end was $5,757. I sent the failed code inspections and the estimates to the sellers asking that they bring the work up to code per our contract. The sellers responded through my real estate agent that they are too busy to have their people come out.  They asked if there was a financial solution that we could come to for me to get the work done. I told them that since work often goes over the estimated cost, I would like the payment of the higher estimates because they would not be billed directly for the actual cost of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I received a response that they are willing to give me half of what I asked for, which does not even cover the lower estimate for electrical work that is required.  I find this completely unacceptable. The code inspectors and my family friend all seem to think that the seller&amp;#39;s agent, title attorney, mortgage company and any of the professional parties in this deal should have not allowed the deal to close.&lt;/p&gt;

Looking for all the real estate lawyers here please!

I (m, 27) live with my girlfriend (f, 23) in Brooklyn, New York. Our relationship has been turbulent to say the least over the last few months and it looks like we are going to have to break our lease and go our separate ways.

**Our lease doesn't end until 12/31/2020. Both my name and hers is on the lease.** 

This brings me to my questions.

* Do we attempt to sublet the apartment on our own? Or do we attempt talking to the landlord about breaking our lease entirely and only moving out once he has a new tenant is ready to move in (maybe a landlord would be more receptive that)?
* If we break the lease but do only move out when a new tenant is ready to move in will this affect our credit/ ability to rent apartments on our own in the future?
* If we break the lease and move out when a new tenant is ready to move in will this affect our security deposit? Will there be early termination fees?

I'm trying to think of options where we can end the lease but the landlord doesn't lose any money on the rental unit.

&lt;p&gt;My question is, am I allowed to know what kind of risk I&amp;#39;m taking by signing it, what kind of information will I be withholding, etc. Also, is it even allowed to threaten someone&amp;#39;s job if they don&amp;#39;t sign an NDA if I wasn&amp;#39;t told before I took the job that I would have to sign one?? I work for a pretty large company and this all seems absurd to me. I went to school for years to get were job and i don&amp;#39;t want to lose it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be appreciated, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

My fiancee (20F) and I (20M) are planning to marry this summer. I am a native-born US Citizen and I will be beginning dental school in August in America (I started undergrad at 16). I met my fiancee a little over 3 years ago on her foreign exchange year when she was a junior in high school, and we have done distance for a little over 2.5 years. She has been attending dental school in her own country, with the idea to eventually do a specialty program to become accredited in America. However, we are both very tired of the distance, and I have applied for a scholarship opportunity that, if I am accepted, would give me the financial means to marry her and take care of my tuition and our combined living expenses. Then, I would cosign a loan for her tuition to go to dental hygiene school.

I do not know very much about immigration law, but I do know that generally speaking F-1 visas process a lot more quickly than any type of spousal or fiancee visa. This means that the goal would be for my fiancee to come via an F-1 visa and marry me, and later switch to a CR1 visa. Essentially, my question is, would this constitute visa fraud? She truly does want to attend dental hygiene school and would complete the program if she enters the country via this route, but she also does want to marry me and live with me in America. We would have no issue waiting to switch visas until the end of her education if that would make a difference.  I would like to know what the best way to handle this is.

Originally, when I was transferring from community college to university, I wanted her to come on a K-1 fiancee visa (which would process during her senior year in her home country) and marry me and do hygiene school then, but we had only been dating for about a year at that point, I had never met her parents who do not speak English, and her family had major reservations to this plan because they believed it would be costly and irresponsible due to our age and having only dated for a year. Now, I speak their language to a fair degree and may soon have the finances to avoid loans for anything other than my fiancee's tuition, and I now have completed my bachelor's degree, so I believe I can convince her family to give me their blessing to marry her as long as I end up with the scholarship. However, I do not want to have to wait an entire year longer while her K-1 visa processes, and she would have to wait another year to begin hygiene school.  So, if there is any possible way to make this work to where she begins school on a F-1 visa and marries me, then later switches to a spousal visa, that would be the ideal route, both in terms of her education and our personal happiness.

Now, I speak their language to a fair degree and may soon have the finances to avoid loans for anything other than my fiancee&amp;#39;s tuition, and I now have completed my bachelor&amp;#39;s degree, so I believe I can convince her family to give me their blessing to marry her as long as I end up with the scholarship. However, I do not want to have to wait an entire year longer while her K-1 visa processes, and she would have to wait another year to begin hygiene school.  So, if there is any possible way to make this work to where she begins school on a F-1 visa and marries me, then later switches to a spousal visa, that would be the ideal route, both in terms of her education and our personal happiness. I greatly appreciate any advice on the situation :)&lt;/p&gt;

Location: Ontario Canada (LocationBot didn't understand \[CAN-Ont\] I guess\]

**Background:**

My GF moved into my house a few years ago and has been paying rent on a monthly basis (inconsistent amounts as she went back to school and paid what she could afford to).  She has now graduated and is working full-time.

**Situation:**

I've owed my house for about 10 years now and have a decent amount of equity built up in it.

**Question:**

Would us becoming common law (after 3 years if I'm correct) entitle her to a portion of the equity in the event that we were to separate?

If I were to add her to title/mortgage, is their a way for me to protect my equity while allowing her to split future payments and build joint equity moving forward?

I reached out to a lawyer near me to discuss these questions, but their hourly rate is a little steep to simply find out the basics before moving forward with any paperwork.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago I was in the market for a new car, I found one online from the local dealership at a good deal and it was listed as Certified Pre-Owned so would come with the extended warranties. Throughout the whole transaction it was never mentioned that the car had previously been in an accident and had structural damage. I found this out from another dealership when getting it appraised. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the dealership that sold me the car and they gave me the run around saying that they couldn't do anything but treat it like a regular trade in for a new vehicle. I feel that I should have been made aware of the underlying damage and the apparent lack of CPO Warranty that was never told to me prior to purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

I paid for a car that was CPO and damage free and now it is obviously worth much less due to it being damaged prior to my ownership.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not sure what actions to take, I have already talked with the dealership and they were not much help, I am in the process of getting in touch with the auto group that owns the dealership to see if that could help. Should I get a lawyer? Should I contact the manufacturer?

My friend (19F) has been living with her (emotionally) abusive aunt and uncle for nearly two years,  and she's finally ready to get out. I'm going to help her move, as is her bf. We have no plans to get violent or anything,  but we're not going to let them manipulate her into staying longer, either.

They are hyper-controlling, to the point of not wanting her to leave for a in-person apartment application (they are terrified of Covid, in-person is mandatory to get these apartments), which has pushed my friend over her limit,  and she wants out like this week.  (She's going to live with me both now and in the apartment we're applying for.)

Is there anything we need to know to help protect her?  Or anything her aunt and uncle can do to stop her? 

(Particular legal codes would be awesome,  I'd love to make it very clear to them that we have both the moral and legal high ground,  which I'm pretty confident we do.)

Also,  should we see if we can get a police officer to assist,  or call them only if they refuse to let her go? (At which point I think it'd be unlawful imprisonment,  right? )

We are in Travis County, Texas, for reference.

On 5/5/20 I got an email from a collection agency stating that DirectTV put a collection out on me for $149.63 but will settle for $112.22. Being late in the day I decided to call DirectTV at 10AM the next day (5/6/20).

&amp;#x200B;

On 5/6/20 I called DirectTV to find out the reason for the collection &amp; they said it was a cancellation fee that they sent me in mail but they sent it to the wrong address after explaining to them 3x (I have emailed transcripts of the conversation) that I moved &amp; given them the new address.

The DirectTV supervisor apologized &amp; said DirectTV will wave the cancellation fee &amp; notify the collection agency that its been resolved.

5/7/20 I called DirectTV to confirm they notified the collection agency of the resolved money &amp; they now did a 360 on me stating I owe the money &amp; that they can't wave the cancellation fee or notify the collection agency. I told the DirectTV representative  I have their supervisor on a recorded audio that it was to be taken care of but the DirectTV representative didn't care.

I called the collection agency &amp; explained the entire DirectTV conversation I just had &amp; told the collection agency I have a DirectTV supervisor on audio recording that it was resolved &amp; to be taken care of.

What is going on? Should I be worried? Are they trying to cut off my unemployment? I've been with them 2+ years.

Had issues with the landlady constantly coming into the apartment when I’m not home without warning.

She decides after a year I need a lease. I don’t like the terms of the lease, trying to have me give three months notice of moving. Trying to lock me in to keep paying her even after I move. So I never signed it because an opportunity came up to move with a friend. So I wrote a letter with my intention to move by May 1st. I paid her the March rent and when April first came gave her the whole month of April. She tried to get me out two weeks prior because she apparently had a new tenant interested to move in while I was still living there. So I couldn’t move yet, new place wasn’t ready. So she lost the tenant. Feeling bad for her like I put her in a spot, I told her I’d give her partial month rent for May. She said ok because May was a bust with no tenant. She even said in a text if she had someone to move in she wouldn’t take my money. Now she never told me about the tenant but I know she had someone move in May 1st. Now she won’t stop texting me, leaving notes on my car, and today she said she is going to come to my place of work. I feel this is harassment. She’s threatening court and everything.

I’m in Maryland. I was renting a garage apartment from a friend of a friend. Never signed a lease. Had issues with the landlady constantly coming into the apartment when I’m not home without warning. Lowering the temperature of the heating unit in the apartment, cleaning what she thought was messy(it wasn’t), over feeding the cat and things like that. Fast forward to the end of February. She decides after a year I need a lease. I don’t like the terms of the lease, trying to have me give three months notice of moving. Trying to lock me in to keep paying her even after I move. So I never signed it because an opportunity came up to move with a friend. So I wrote a letter with my intention to move by May 1st. I paid her the March rent and when April first came gave her the whole month of April. She tried to get me out two weeks prior because she apparently had a new tenant interested to move in while I was still living there. So I couldn’t move yet, new place wasn’t ready. So she lost the tenant. Feeling bad for her like I put her in a spot, I told her I’d give her partial month rent for May. She said ok because May was a bust with no tenant. She even said in a text if she had someone to move in she wouldn’t take my money. Now she never told me about the tenant but I know she had someone move in May 1st. Now she won’t stop texting me, leaving notes on my car, and today she said she is going to come to my place of work. I feel this is harassment. She’s threatening court and everything. Said the bathroom floor is ruined by the litter box even though I didn’t have it directly on the floor and that the three screws I used to hang something was a hard fix with $700.

My 14 year old niece was an unplanned pregnancy when my sister was 20. Her and my niece's father were together for about 6 months after she was born. My sister also found out he was cheating on her the entire pregnancy and got another woman pregnant at the same time.

,legaladvice,"Hello, I live in the the American state of Tennessee and I've been running into an issue that I could use some legal advice on. I moved to Tennessee a couple months ago, and I needed to setup an appointment with a psychiatrist so that I could continue the psychiatric care that I have been receiving for several years.


I had an an initial visit with the doctor, where I spoke with the doctor for about half an hour. I filed with insurance but I also prepaid which they said they would only apply if insurance didn't cover things. I come back three months later in March, and this time I see the doctor for 5 minutes at the most. He asks me if I think I need therapy I say no. He asks if the medication is going well, I say yes. He writes the prescription and says to speak with the receptionist about my next appointment, everything up to now is fine.


That office visit occurred in March, and it is now obviously may. I received a bill last week saying that I got billed for the office visit but also 30 minutes of psychotherapy. I called the doctor's office to say I had not received any psychotherapy. They said that they apply that charge to every visit regardless of length and regardless of what takes place.


I called my insurance provider(I can provide this name but I don't know if that's allowed. It is a large national provider) and told them what I have written here. They told me they would call the office of the Psychiatrist and talk to the staff there and call me back next week(now). My insurance called me and told me they could not get in contact with the office, and they don't plan on doing anything else.

I moved to Tennessee a couple months ago, and I needed to setup an appointment with a psychiatrist so that I could continue the psychiatric care that I have been receiving for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an an initial visit with the doctor, where I spoke with the doctor for about half an hour. I filed with insurance but I also prepaid which they said they would only apply if insurance didn&amp;#39;t cover things. I come back three months later in March, and this time I see the doctor for 5 minutes at the most. He asks me if I think I need therapy I say no. He asks if the medication is going well, I say yes. He writes the prescription and says to speak with the receptionist about my next appointment, everything up to now is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That office visit occurred in March, and it is now obviously may. I received a bill last week saying that I got billed for the office visit but also 30 minutes of psychotherapy. I called the doctor&amp;#39;s office to say I had not received any psychotherapy. They said that they apply that charge to every visit regardless of length and regardless of what takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called my insurance provider(I can provide this name but I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s allowed. It is a large national provider) and told them what I have written here. They told me they would call the office of the Psychiatrist and talk to the staff there and call me back next week(now). My insurance called me and told me they could not get in contact with the office, and they don&amp;#39;t plan on doing anything else. I said that I always get through to a person quite quickly and they may have the wrong number, but they were no longer interested in the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

,legaladvice,"Hi, I had a few questions regarding recording of audio and video in California. 

My landlord regularly comes and bangs extremely hard on my door (to the point the entire door shakes and looks like it is about to detach) whenever he wants to have a conversation regarding rent and repairs etc. He has my phone number but he keeps communicating me this way, coming at random hours on random days. It is a very jarring and stress inducing experience knowing that this can happen at any point of the day; when I am studying for my college classes or just got out of the shower etc. 

Sometimes he also throws insults and threats like ""I don't care that you are a foreigner and don't know the laws. I will pay an attorney 5k and fuck you up if you don't do [XYZ]"" or ""I will sue you and you will have to abandon your education here and go back to your country"" , ironically for things he is actually legally in the wrong about... He also gets very aggressive and in my face whenever he is doing this stuff.

So anyway, I have recently decided to start recording this stuff seeing how all these behaviors could constitute harassment and violate the covenant of quiet enjoyment. I have set up an old laptop in my living room to face my unit's door and record (video only) nonstop, basically acting as a security camera. 

I am also thinking of recording the audio of these conversations in front of my door but I know this gets very tricky in California due to the two-party consent requirements. 

**My questions:**

**1-** Am I legally in the clear for using my old laptop as a hidden surveillance cam (in my living room) that faces the door, in order to record his physical aggressiveness as well as the door physically shaking due to his banging at random hours?

**2-** Can I legally record the audio of these conversations without asking for consent, since he regularly threatens and insults me? If I have to ask for consent, how can I do it without ""pressuring"" him to give consent? Can I say ""Due to your past threatening language towards me, I intend to record this conversation for my own safety. Do you consent?"" and if he doesn't, can I say the following?

We were able to get in today with the child advocacy center. First the team assigned to the case spoke with myself and her father. I explained why we were all here(bleeding, accidents, daughter (4) telling me her fathers roommate puts things in her butt). Father then says along the lines of “again this is a misunderstanding, I know what happened, he was telling her to pull her pants up so he put a marker in her butt crack.”

We are taken to lobby and social worker then takes daughter to interview her. While this is happening two social workers come to speak with us about a physical exam,they explain it’s a consent led exam and daughter is allowed to stop at any time . They leave I turn to father and tell him I think it’s a good idea to proceed. He gets very angry telling me I don’t get to make that decision and I’ll be hearing from his lawyer. I try to explain why I feel such way and he just kept saying it’s too much trauma and I don’t have the right to make the choice(legally I do). 

They finish interview with daughter and we(mom and dad) go back into meeting room with the team. The police officer assigned to the case explains that she didn’t say anything to the social worker that would cause them to believe anything happened and the case is officially closed. 

My lawyer is in mediation all day and will not be available to talk until tomorrow. 

So. Obviously I do NOT want any of this to be true or happening to my daughter, but am I crazy for finding it extremely inappropriate for a grown man to think sticking a marker in a toddlers butt crack is ok? Or that he was testing to see what he could get away with? I also just found out he has a degree in behavioral analysis.....which is more upsetting. Do I have any ground to stand on by requesting the removal of said roommate before visitation is allowed again?

The only image I have where you can see the carpet is on Dec. 2018 where I took a picture of shoes I was selling, you can see it's a stained carpet. I moved out in April 2019.

They began renovating the house to get ready to sell as I was leaving. New countertops, new paint in the halls etc. I believe they just want me to pay for the carpet they already needed to replace before selling. But I have no proof.

Anyway, I've accepted I probably won't get the deposit back, but on principle, I do not want to pay the utility bill.

One thing to note is after about 6 months of living their my roommate moved his girlfriend in one day without asking me. We continued to split utilities 50/50.

Additionally the first 3-4 months I paid roughly 75% of the utility bill because he would be working in other states for 1-2 weeks at a time, (even though his girlfriend started coming over a lot). Then he stopped working away from home so we split 50/50, but never adjusted the price when his girlfriend moved in.

Lastly, (and I have all the messages saved) he forgot to pay the utility bill the second month I moved in. The power company shuts us off. He was away working &amp; wasn't affected all. I come home from work on a hot August day night in Florida, all my food in the fridge is now garbage. I can't get someone to come out until tomorrow. So after I throw all my food out I have to get a hotel room at 8pm. That was $100+ and very inconvenient. And then wind up fronting the full $300+ power bill to get it turned back on (which he quickly pays me back for).

Do I have a good case to not pay them the utility bill? Again, the only things I could prove would be my hotel receipt and our texts with him not shutting off the power, and probably his GF living with us.

None of them include a watermark or the stores logo or anything. Just really nice professional looking pictures of food. Could he come after me for doing this and should i copyright my own pictures? Any and all help is really appreciated guys. Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it makes a difference, im in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

They gave me a big list of things that need done, such as tires, bearings, struts, brakes, calipers, and a bunch more.  I'm not a car guy, so I'm not sure what some of those parts are.  Also strangely enough, they found a fuel cap cover wedged underneath the car.  This is like a mini manhole cover, about a foot or so in diameter and maybe weights 10 lbs.  It's pretty bulky, and it's crazy how my car could have eaten it.

I called the customer service number for the gas station.  They were very helpful and nice as I explained the situation.  Long story short, they did confirm that the gas station I visit was missing one of their covers from earlier in the week.  I have a fuel rewards type of deal with them, so it can help them know when I actually came up there and pull surveillance footage.  I sent them a picture of the cap, as well as pictures of the quote the mechanic gave me.  This quote is for everything I need to do for the car, including things not caused by this cap such as worn out tires or window wiper blades.  

The next step customer service told me was to ask them for a diagnostic report that would detail exactly where they found the cap, and what kind of damages it causes.  The mechanic wasn't very helpful, as he said there isn't any report he could write up.  The best he could do is have me bring the cap back to them and they can stage a picture of where it was under my car.  There wasn't anything on the quote of things he said could have been broken.

,legaladvice,"I (19M) was with my abusive ex for about 5 months (24/25M). He was coming out of a bad relationship himself so with barely knowing him, I offered him to stay at my apartment with his cats and dogs (2 dogs and 2 cats). I needed a roommate as mine had just moved out, and I thought it’d be perfect (Im young and stupid I know). I had no idea for the hell I would live in. He was controlling and emotionally manipulative (I couldn’t go to classes because “what about him” and “I didn’t really love him if I went” + any time I would go he’d go into a suicidal rampage). During this time I also had a dog. One day he came home with another dog. Then another. Then another. And cats too. I repeatedly asked him to stop and he never did, and he expected me to solely care for the animals, pay the bills (including 1100/mo rent), all while he never worked and had my bank info so any time I got money he’d immediately use it for himself. Any time I’d confront him he’d go into a suicidal bout and talk about how he should “just kill himself” then. Because of the apartment conditions I eventually developed a kidney infection with an uncommon strain and was completely bathroom/bed ridden. Eventually there were 10 dogs and 10 cats in this apartment (including my now 2 dogs, who I took care of separately and went out of my way to make sure were as healthy as I could provide for and had separate food, toys, and treats). Animal control was called and all animals were seized, I went to court to get my dogs back and spent 2000+ in lawyer fees and general court fees as they said I was an accessory (my parent wound up being able to get my original dog back which sucks I couldn’t get the other one too but hey what’re you going to do). During the court case the cop repeatedly misgendered me (We’re both FtM) and *laughed* when I said I had had a kidney infection and that I’m blind (I was diagnosed at birth with a rare genetic condition, I have the medical documents to back up both these claims) and it was generally awful. The worst though was after the animals were seized I had moved out after my ex had raped me (He got me blackout drunk while he was sober so he could sleep with me thinking it’d get me to stay as he knew after my animals I hated him and didn’t want to be with him and to get away. I already had a friend who was actively trying to help me leave) and my ex squated on the property and wouldn’t let me pick up my stuff. I salvaged what I could from when I had moved out but the rest had to be thrown out, and countless memories with yearbooks and what not were lost because he wouldn’t let me inside. Do I have any legal recourse to get money from him so I can get fees back, money for new stuff or *something*? Sorry this was long.

,legaladvice,"Here's a quick summary of my situation: about seven months ago, I had an emergency and needed to move out of state to be closer to family. I talked it over with my roommate (Mike) at the time, since we were only halfway through our lease and I didn't want to leave him high and dry. He said he was comfortable with me leaving, and instead of breaking our lease wanted to sublet my room to one of his friends (Sarah).

After explaining the situation to our landlord, the landlord said that we would have to sort the details ourselves as far as replacing initial finances (first/last month's rent and security deposit). I first texted Mike to explain that I would send an email asking Sarah for first month's rent (a prorated amount for the month I was moving out, since I had already paid for that full month), last month's rent, and the security deposit in the amount of one month's rent. He agreed that this would be fair. I then sent an email to Mike, Sarah, and CC-ed myself explaining the same thing. After sending it, I got a text from Mike saying that it wasn't fair for Sarah to pay this much because ""nobody has that kind of money to move"" (red flag #1). We went back and forth and eventually agreed that she would not have to worry about the security deposit, since I ""would probably get it back anyways"".

Fast forward to the week I am about to move out, Mike comes tome and explains that it's unfair for Sarah to pay last month's rent and that she should only pay first month's rent (red flag #2). At this point he already knows that I have quit my job and made plans to live in another state, so it's too late for me to stay at this point. I pushed back and explained that I thought it was fair because I essentially already paid her last month of living, and therefore she should pay me back. After going back in forth, Mike verbally agreed to reimburse me for last month's rent. On my move-out day, I was venmo-ed the prorated first month's rent and was told that Mike would venmo me at some point for last month's rent (red flag #3).

Within a few weeks of moving, I tried reaching out to Mike about last month's rent. He never responded. I decided to wait until our last month of the original lease (this month) and then reach out to Sarah to see if she had planned on paying me. I tried reaching out repeatedly over Venmo and text but was ignored. It had been three weeks of me trying to get in touch with her.

My last month's rent was around $750. As someone in their mid-20's with chronic illness, that's a lot of money to me. I'm incredibly anxious because I'm still not sure if I will get my security deposit back, which would total around $1500 lost from this living situation.

It this worth taking my subletter to small claims court for? Do I have a case? I have text and email receipts of agreements for her to pay my last month's rent, but am not sure if this is enough.

If we go back to work, we will be making less than what base unemployment is in our state (FL). We will be making around $250 a week before taxes.

,legaladvice,"I’m (24F) back again because of my crazy sister L (34F). Several years ago my mom (61F) added L to the deed of her home. My moms reasoning was 2/4 kids were minors, L was in her early to mid 20s. And my mom didn’t have a husband to leave her home to. I believe she was ill advised by her lawyer and L didn’t need to be added to the deed. I still live with my mom while trying to get out of student debt and save for a home. I do not pay rent but my mom has never asked me to and I help out with what I can. L lives in her own home. 

Anyway, let’s fast forward to September 2019. L and I got into an argument over her kids (8F and 4F) making the house messy and having no respect for people’s belongings. One of the kids took a bracelet from me that holds the ashes of a loved one. I was made at L for not disciplining her kids or cleaning up after them. L threatened to put a protective order on me and have me thrown out of my moms house. She did not have cause for this as I never threatened her or became violent. L stated she was my “landlord” and I need to respect her. This caused a huge fight between L and my mom. I’m the youngest and so my mom is very protective of me. My mom asked L to remove her name from the Deed. L refused to sign and told my mom she was dead to her. It took several weeks but things calmed down until March 2020. 

In March my moms health drastically declined. She was in the hospital/rehab for over a month. She is home now. Since admission to the hospital, L went insane. She told the hospital she was an only child and became my moms POA while my mom was unable to make decisions for herself. L refused to update me and my 2 other siblings on my moms progress and told nurses they weren’t allowed to speak with us. I called the hospital prior and they were shocked to find my mom had 3 more kids but they couldn’t do anything to help. This caused a huge fight between my 2 other siblings and myself against L. L again threatened to kick me out of my home. 

It is very stressful to think I could be thrown out of the home I’ve lived in my whole life. I understand with COVID-19 evictions cannot happen right now. I’m worried when this is over what will happen. My mom wants me to stay here. I am the primary caregiver to my mom and she needs me. It’s not good for my mental health knowing L could come here anytime she pleases, move in, or kick me out. Is there anything my mom and I can do to protect me? L and my mom are not speaking currently. A few days ago I had to call the police because L was screaming at my mom and refused to leave. L accused me of stealing from her. I do not have what she wants and I told her it’s somewhere in my moms room but I’m really not sure where. Things have been shuffled and moved around. The police told me they cannot make L leave because she is on the deed. 

I could move out but then the issue of who will take care of my mom comes up. I want to do what’s best for my mom because this may be her last few months. But I also know I need to take care of myself. I’m so stressed out I can’t eat or sleep because of L. She has a history of violence and so does her husband (he was in prison for attempted murder).

,legaladvice,"So I live in a small military town called El Paso Texas and a few days ago we had a pipe bust and start leaking in my apparment ceiling. We called and had maintenance come to fix it. Now to set the scene; the leak and issue was in a small closet area in a small alclove area off from my hallway next to my roomates room and wasnt a area I could stay in easily with the big equipment they needed in such a small area. That small area has a desk with lots of my roomates things like his PC, router, and a few snacks and such. He ended up moving a lot of his stuff and moved his wallet to the corner so it wouldnt get knocked off as he is super OCD about always having it on the desk. It was a gift from his Dad who died when he was 10 and has everything from his military ID to his social. It also had a lot of papers for his upcoming deployment and lots of other things; credit and debit cards, etc. When maintenance left the wallet was gone. He had it with him earlier and moved it to the corner of the desk and I saw it earlier myself. I went to the office to make a complaint and ask to have it possibly even dropped back anonymously in our mail so I dont have to persue this.

We called and had maintenance come to fix it. Now to set the scene; the leak and issue was in a small closet area in a small alclove area off from my hallway next to my roomates room and wasnt a area I could stay in easily with the big equipment they needed in such a small area. That small area has a desk with lots of my roomates things like his PC, router, and a few snacks and such. He ended up moving a lot of his stuff and moved his wallet to the corner so it wouldnt get knocked off as he is super OCD about always having it on the desk. It was a gift from his Dad who died when he was 10 and has everything from his military ID to his social. It also had a lot of papers for his upcoming deployment and lots of other things; credit and debit cards, etc. When maintenance left the wallet was gone. He had it with him earlier and moved it to the corner of the desk and I saw it earlier myself. I went to the office to make a complaint and ask to have it possibly even dropped back anonymously in our mail so I dont have to persue this.

I have an opportunity for some small freelance work. Nothing major or full time. A couple hundred here and there. Some weeks it may add up to full time work.

Here's the elephant in the room: if I take this freelance work, it would go against what I get paid out in unemployment, and on certain weeks it may completely eradicate my weekly benefits. So if I make 600 or so a week, I would be ineligible to receive any amount of UI, including the extra 600. So I'm making less as a result, but I'm being productive and have opportunities to make money.

I am, however, worried that due to something vague in employment law, if I work enough, I will be considered fully ""self-employed"" and thus lose my benefits altogether when I really want to make extra cash and fully intend on going back to my job full-time once the furlough ends.

Even if we were able to move everything out for a day, nothing is going to prevent the fleas from coming back inside. They need to treat the complex. When I mentioned that she said that she doesn't know if she can..???? It's a never ending cycle.

Hi, sorry if this is kinda vague. 

My family had some bad times a few years ago during which are old home “went under” and we couldn’t pay for it anymore. There was also a brief time in which my parents lived separately. During this time a man from my dad’s church offered him a home to rent since he was moving out anyways. He doesn’t pay for any house maintenance even though the house is literally falling apart with several broken windows, rotting support pillars, and peeling paint. There was a time in which the garage stopped working, and he didn’t want to pay for the repair. My dad has to literally ask him to help pay since my dad is a good renter and never missed payments, and that the renter could at least pay half. 

There wasn’t a contact agreement written or signed between the renter and my dad.

Do I have any leverage on this guy to report him to anything since it’s still *his* property but he refuses to maintain it despite renting it out? Is it even possible he that can be reported without them singing a contract together?

Edit: the broken windows are in my mom’s bedroom and those same windows also are above the patio. I’ve been told to not sit in certain areas since it’s at risk of if/when the glass breaks.

,legaladvice,"Hi, 

Basically I moved to this state at the tail end of December after graduating college to start my new job beginning of January. When I moved here; I opened up my mailbox for the first time and had the previous tenants' junk mail; I didn't really think much of it and gave it to the head of management (we'll call her Sam); What should have  probably been a red flag was how shocked Sam was because apparently the previous tenant moved out August which should have been ample amount of time to change address to these places. I gave her the mail and we let it go... to be completely honest I didn't really mind the very few junk mail anyways I would just throw them away...As time progressed,  I moved to paying all bills online and stopped checking the mail as frequently. If I had gotten anything associated with her name that was junk mail I'd send it to the manager and eventually just stopped out of annoyance ( I would just leave it in my mailbox since most of it was junk mail ; Also, I stopped sifting through to figure out which ones I should send to Sam). Flash forward to yesterday ..after not checking my mail for almost two months Most of my mail if not all contsisted of work pay stubs, unemployment checks, a stimulus check, car bill notices, outstanding electricity bills for this apartment before me, and the rest was filled to the brim with junk mail...  I'm now fed up. I sent an email to Sam again and she will be taking all her mail to attempt to send to the previous tenant. I  passive aggressively told Sam to get in contact with this previous tenant and tell her to change all of the damn address; it been nearly 5 months!

&lt;p&gt;Basically I moved to this state at the tail end of December after graduating college to start my new job beginning of January. When I moved here; I opened up my mailbox for the first time and had the previous tenants&amp;#39; junk mail; I didn&amp;#39;t really think much of it and gave it to the head of management (we&amp;#39;ll call her Sam); What should have  probably been a red flag was how shocked Sam was because apparently the previous tenant moved out August which should have been ample amount of time to change address to these places. I gave her the mail and we let it go... to be completely honest I didn&amp;#39;t really mind the very few junk mail anyways I would just throw them away...As time progressed,  I moved to paying all bills online and stopped checking the mail as frequently. If I had gotten anything associated with her name that was junk mail I&amp;#39;d send it to the manager and eventually just stopped out of annoyance ( I would just leave it in my mailbox since most of it was junk mail ; Also, I stopped sifting through to figure out which ones I should send to Sam). Flash forward to yesterday ..after not checking my mail for almost two months Most of my mail if not all contsisted of work pay stubs, unemployment checks, a stimulus check, car bill notices, outstanding electricity bills for this apartment before me, and the rest was filled to the brim with junk mail...  I&amp;#39;m now fed up. I sent an email to Sam again and she will be taking all her mail to attempt to send to the previous tenant. I  passive aggressively told Sam to get in contact with this previous tenant and tell her to change all of the damn address; it been nearly 5 months! So my question is...is there anything I can do about this? Can I cut it up or something because my patience has completely evaporated? Im super new to the state and this situation so I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure where to even start. I also should note it&amp;#39;s the first time I&amp;#39;ve ever rented an apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi, I'm a horse and I'm in a bit of a bind at work.

I'm a ""salesman"" at work by title, but really I got delegated to take care of the sales legwork. I fill in orders, make sure they ship, fill out the required tax forms including a shipping label and commercial invoice, and do the same for when someone needs a part to repair our products or for whatever reason. These are often large orders of expensive machines across borders, usually from NY where I am to factories in China, Korea, or Japan, though the issue happens both internationally and when we ship nationally, usually to universities.

Until I left for corona leave, there was a woman who oversaw the whole process. Really I was easing her job, so she just knew how everything was done at my company. She always wanted me to give false values on the commercial invoices and other forms ""for tax reasons"" which I'm pretty sure is a sly way of saying ""so we can commit tax fraud."" These are often $100,000-200,000 products we list as $200, or at the very least $5,000 listed for $5. The second happens every day, the first more like monthly. I did this because it was a part of my job, but I made sure to let them know I'm uncomfortable with this and the only reason I'm doing it is because my overseer was always the one to put her signature on it, leaving me blameless (?). (Note: I think I'm on one or two of the earlier ones, before I realized that something sketchy is happening.) Well of course while I was gone they shat on her and she left. Now I'm going to be expected to do the same, but I don't want to break any laws for a sketchy company I don't even like.

Would I be held legally responsible for what I've done so far? 

Should I be turning these people in?

Who would prosecution go after? I actually like the woman who quit.

I've seen the IRS gives a reward for people who help with significant cases of tax fraud, is this something I can claim a reward on? Would I be incriminated to the point I could not get a reward? Am I looking at jail time?

I am considering sending an email to my idiot CEO when I get back basically saying ""I think what you're asking me to do is illegal, do I have to do it?"" I think he would send an email back saying ""yes or you're fired"" but I don't want to get too deep in this before I know what the legal situation is.

Pre-quarantine: A year ago every single day, the neighbor next door would knock on the door so damn loud that neighbors from the other side of the building would be able to hear it. You would think why I would be complaining about knocking but they actually knock for at least 30 minutes for the other person to open and it’s at 5AM in the morning, EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I’m not even exaggerating. The neighbor thst was living next to them yelled at the person knocking that he would break his door if he doesn’t stop. You think he would stop but nah. It just kept omg going on. And I’m pretty sure they drove that person away because I see a different person coming in and out of there now.

Quarantine: They’ve got a pet dog. It’s not bad that they have a dog, I’m not complaining about that they got a dog. But I am complaining about his their dog ACTUALLY BARK FOR LITERAL HOURS AND THEY WON’T EVEN STOP AND CONTROL HIM/HER. Any time of the day, you name it the dog provides it, they won’t care. When the dog stops barking, it’s their cue to start blasting their music. 

I’ve texted one neighbor from the other side of the building if they could provide me some info to tone it down. He replied with 311 or housing management number. Otherwise, wear ear plugs. Apparently they have been letting their dog pee on their side of the building.

&lt;p&gt;Pre-quarantine: A year ago every single day, the neighbor next door would knock on the door so damn loud that neighbors from the other side of the building would be able to hear it.

,legaladvice,"I have an adult friend (21+) I have known for a few years. After confronting her parents over childhood abuse they had her committed. Her parents are very controlling and had her leave San Francisco County and stay at their house in San Jose. 

Her parents co own her condo in SF and have keys to her place, so they came over and convinced her to leave SF and go to SJ. Upon arriving in SJ they said she needed to take a bunch of meds and they called to get a prescription from her psych. The prescribed some sort of relaxing pill , and she told her doctor she does not consent to taking this. 

So after a day at her parents house she told them she wants to go home to SF and they said no. During a car ride she asked for them to let her out of the car and they restrained her and said she couldn’t leave 

Upon the end of the car ride she gets back to her parents house and eats a meal prepared by her parents. She falls asleep and wakes up a few hours later. 

When she wakes up she again asks to leave their house in SJ. They say no. She says I want to go to the hospital , they said no. So she decides to tell them she’s feeling suicidal and if they don’t take her to the hospital she will kill herself. She said she wrote a suicide note. She says this was a lie and no note was ever written 

So they called the police and the cops came. My friend is adamant she started to comply. The police asked her if she was ok and she said I want to go to the hospital to escape my parents. Then the police said ok are you ready to go and she said yes. So the officer said , What drugs have you taken if any? Friend says no, and then her mom chimes in “ she took an anti psychotic”. My friend told the police she never took that and told the officer she expressly didn’t consent and she asked the officer “is that legal? Can she drug me”

The cop said it’s legal if it’s prescribed. At this point she still thought this was a joke being played on her by her parents. 

So then she was admitted to the hospital, and eventually they wrote that they found a suicide note. She was kept at the hospital for 7 days for paranoia and delusions. During the stay she kept saying I wasn’t suicidal but her families input said she is delusional. 

After she is released she goes home to her apartment which her parents and her own. 

At this point her parents have said they will randomly come and do home checks on her, without her consent. She is worried that if her parents begin contacting her therapist and psychiatrist again, they will be able to have have her committed once again . 

What are her options to make sure her parents do not harass her anymore in her apartment? She is not manic or delusional or a harm to herself no others- what should she do? I suggested she change her locks and file a police report detailing her parents harassing behavior.

I'm trying to figure out what to do in regards to purchasing a new motorcycle.  In the state of Georgia, it is illegal for a dealership to advertise the price of a vehicle and then tack on extra fees such as dealership fees and whatnot.  Only government fees can be added afterwards. The links to the law can be found in several locations here from the state:

I have already been to several dealerships to purchase a bike and they all say the fees aren't illegal at all.  That's how they stay in business.  However, when I show them the law that states all fees have to be included in the advertised price online minus only government fees such as tax tag title, they all just say I'm wrong and they won't do anything about it.  I called the governors office and they said I can file a report on each dealership but they only act if either A) I have a contract showing they added fees afterwards or B) they get so many alerts from people that shows a trend. 

My question is, what would ya'll do?  Do I just suck it up, pay the fees and then go argue it in small claims court since the law is on my side?  How can I get the state to enforce their own laws or even the dealership to see reason?  Apparently every dealership is still doing this.

,legaladvice,"For context, I am a foreign student in the UK. I received my unconditional letter in June, and applied for student halls once registration opened about week later.
Now, I wanted to get a job to pay for my accommodation, food, etc (being from outside the UK I wasn't eligible for maintenance grants), so I decided to move to the UK a month prior to University starting (on 20th Sep 2014) so I could get a job before all the students got there and applied for them. So I booked a flight for the 13th of August 2014.
My student halls wouldn't accept students moving in prior to the 20th of September, so I needed a place to stay for the period between arriving at England and moving into the halls. 
By late July, however, I still hadn't had a definitive answer as to whether my application for the Halls had been successful, so as a precautionary measure, I contacted several landlords, mentioning I'd need a place for this short period prior to 20th Sep. but could possibly need it for the entire year should my application fall through.
I exchanged a couple of emails with a landlord who was happy to oblige. So I arrive on 13th, they ask me for the rent for the entire month plus bills. Cash. There and then. I told them I could only take so much from an ATM daily so I could give them 2/3 now and the rest at a later date. They said OK, I handed the money, they then made me sign the tenancy agreement (more on that in a bit) and I asked to write me an invoice (my dad had drilled it into my 18yo skull, and I can't thank him enough for it). They were quite reluctant as hadn't brought anything to do it but eventually produced an invoice pad from their car, hand wrote one for the amount, gave it to me and left. 
2 days later, I received confirmation of my place at Uni Halls from 20th Sep on, at which time I contact the landlord via phone, let them know and we agree the next time they come down I'll pay the remaining rent for the month + bills for the month. The 2nd (last) invoice I got read 'Balance of rent + part (or ract? It was mostly unintelligible) payment bills'. On the 20th of Sep I move into halls and post my key through the letterbox as they couldn't come and collect it so told me to do this. 

Congratulations for making it through that huge wall of exposition, but we're here now. 6 years later, in the midst of a pandemic and I receive 2 letters from a debt collection agency claiming I owe them gas + electricity for the period of 13/08/2014 - 05/07/2015.
Now, obviously I haven't lived there for this period of time, and I obtained confirmation from my University in writing to state I was contracted with them during these dates, but this raises a couple of questions.

1) It's possible I signed the tenancy agreement for the whole year, since as I mentioned, I hadn't had confirmation. Perhaps I shouldn't, but hey, hindsight. If that is true, am I liable for this bill even though I contacted my landlord and we agreed on a final figure, but didn't sign any further documentation on? (like a termination of the agreement)

2) If we're being pragmatic, there's slim chance a student is renting a property WHILST being simmultaneously contracted with student halls, but I'm not sure if proof that I wasn't living at that address at the time is sufficient to sustain my claim that I should not be liable for these bills.


I'm sure there's things I've forgotten to mention which may be of use to know, like for example I do not have access to the tenancy agreement now, but I still have in my possession the invoices.

Anything else that comes up I'll make sure to update this accordingly.

Hi All,

I had a question regarding potential legal pitfalls of venture I am considering undertaking. I am a university student, and for the past semester have been working on a software project in a small group for a class. For the final deliverable, we produced a working prototype of the software, and after demonstrating the idea to professors, friends, and family, I decided that I would be really interested in moving forward with the project beyond the class and attempting to release the software, with the possibility of incorporating monetization somehow. I talked to my friend in the group and he felt the same way.

However, we would like to keep the other two group members uninvolved in the continuation of the project. They quite frankly did not contribute very much during the semester, and my friend and I strongly believe that we would work much better without them. In fact, if they had to be involved for any reason I would rather forego working on this project and spend my time elsewhere. In terms of contributions, the other two members only completed one or two mock business elements for the class and a few slides on our final pitch deck. Neither of them contributed any code that made it into the submitted deliverable, and contributed &lt;20 lines each in total throughout the semester (and yes, the project in total was thousands of lines of code). I did a vast majority of the code, while my friend handled the designs, wire-frames, asset creation, and a bunch of the business stuff.

Bottom line is that the two of us would like to continue working on this project beyond the scope of our class which is now over, but we want to cut out two of the group members who didn't contribute much despite being ask to several times and given many opportunities to do so in multiple areas. However, we wouldn't want this to come back and bite us in the rear, legally speaking, if we were to publish the software especially if we monetize it. Ethically speaking we are totally fine with the situation since the other members were very hard to deal with and earnestly did not contribute, but we don't want to get sued or anything (we both live in the United States if that makes a difference). Are there any considerations we need to take if we move forward, or is this something that we should not do unless everyone is working on it?

TLDR: Want to publish software made as part of a university project and potentially monetize it. Also want to cut out half of the group from the class who didn't contribute. Could we get screwed?",t2_30r9fnv2,False,,0,False,Cutting University Group Members for Product Continuation,[],r/legaladvice,False,6,,0,False,t3_gggcze,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Computer and Internet,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1589063426.0,text,6,,,text,self.legaladvice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally posted on &lt;a href=""/r/cscareerquestions""&gt;r/cscareerquestions&lt;/a&gt; but was removed and directed to post here.&lt;/p&gt;

So I ordered from a company and way after their already extended timeline I reached out to find out what's going on. I waited until way after their customer response timeline, nothing. I reached out by email and 3 different social media sites. I called the number on their website just to be given another number by an automated message, calling that one and finding out its down right now. At this point I had had enough and so I canceled payment with the bank. I messaged them again through multiple channels to let them know I had done so. All of a sudden I get a message back on Instagram from them and the rep tries to buy me off with ""expedited shipping"" (already signed up from 1-3 days shipping before) and a free ashtray, but I could cancel still if I wanted to. I, again,told them I had already canceled with my bank and I wanted this order canceled on their end too. The rep doesn't respond. Later at 9pm I get an email saying my order has shipped! The next day the rep says ""Oh sorry it's shipped now so it cant be canceled"" That was last week, I checked the tracking and they've only printed the label but its still there in their warehouse and hasn't been touched by USPS. I have time stamped screen shots of all of this.

,legaladvice,"I worked at a large bank for nearly 3 years. I was exceptional in sales goals, customer service, and never once disciplined for any reason during this time. I was promoted 3 times. 


In March 2020, I decided to file an HR complaint on my branch manager. The company requires us as employees to report possible illegal or unethical behavior. I was moving to a new role which involved traveling and would soon not work under the manager. I knew of inappropriate behaviors and sexual encounters between a banker, mortgage rep, district manager, and teller, and heavy favoritism based on romantic reciprocation. Those behaviors had become extreme when I decided to report. I hesitated for a time due to the potential of retaliation. The teller did not reciprocate and in turn was not treated as well. My complaint mentioned this and other well known details by others so I could remain as annonymous as possible. The manager and myself had been friends as I did not want to give myself a difficult work life, but his behavior on countless occasions was not appropriate and often sexually driven. 


When i spoke to an HR investigator about the treatment of others, issues of favoritism, and an inappropriate work relationship, the investigator seemed only interested in the excessive gifts the manager bought a coworker he was romantically interested in. He had twiced asked her to go on a date with him and admitted so, when that is strictly against bank policy due to conflict of interest. I knew this coworker was not romantically interested in return but didn't want her exceptional treatment to change. It was found that the manager was written up for the gifts. In banking, gifts to clients, coworkers, or mortgage partners insinuates possible bribary, legal issues, and unfair treatment. 


This bank also has an extensive ethics policy handbook that can be found online. Early on it preaches the ""do the right thing"" and ensures anonymity(when possible) as well as a zero tolerance policy for employees who are retaliated against for filing a report. The HR investigator I first spoke with told me to reach out to the regional HR representative if I experienced retaliation.


Somehow my identity was known only days after the report and the manager as well as other coworkers were extremely upset for me blowing the whistle. I was treated terribly and excessively micro managed which I had never experienced before. I was scolded and asked to forge paperwork(i believe was an attempt to fire me then but i refused) I documented the incidents that were blatantly wrong with the witnesses and forwarded them to the regional HR rep, as instructed when you experience retaliation. I then speak with another HR rep who doubted my allegations, but all were confirmed by other employees who witnessed some. Weeks pass and the treatment continued to an unbearable level, and I began to take anxiety medication to cope and even told the HR rep I had clinical depression and anxiety and the hostile environment was becoming too much to for me. 


I then was told I was being forced to relocate to another branch this manager also manages 50% of the time. It was not the branch I had applied for and I planned on working. It was then I emailed the regional HR a final time saying I felt nothing was being done and I would not tolerate the retaliatory treatment any longer. I also explained the manager has had many sexual relationships at work and also made me uncomfortable on numerous occasions. I then got a final call from a 3rd HR rep who asked more about the sexual misconduct/harrassment. I gave her names of witnesses and people who knew or saw the same things I did. This was never followed up on. I asked one coworker who experienced inappropiate sexual conduct if she was reached out to, and she told me she was not. It is my understanding all companies are required to in good faith investigate all sexual harrassment claims regardless of their feelings on probability of the incidents. This did not happen and this bank claims to follow through on such claims in addition to retaliation. From what I have read, most companies lose lawsuits by default when they don't investigate protected activities correctly.


I moved to my new role and location and would still see this manager in passing but we did not speak. I felt things were improving but I was also on a project that didn't involve interaction with him. During my first HR investigator call, I sent text messages and work messages supporting my early claim. After the complaint of retaliation I was never asked for more evidence nor for any regarding sexual misconduct. I was asked for names and the bank did not ask those individuals about the accusation. 


On Wednesday April 29, the company sent a mass email to all employees putting dollar amounts on gift giving, I am assuming because of my original HR complaint.

No one was ever disciplined regarding my complaint(less a minor write-up) but instead the company revised its policy. On Friday, May 1st, the district manager came in at the end of my shift and put me on a conference call with the regional HR representative. In a minute or less, she told me I was being terminated as the investigation was closed and they found I complained in bad faith. She also added I had said unkind things about coworkers but did not say who or when. For months I had kept to myself and always treated my coworkers with respect while we worked together. Had they fired me for any other reason(as a model employee they could not find anything it seems), I know I would be screwed due to being an at-will state.

I am seeking your advice and help as when I draw this map together, I realize none of this would have happened if I didn't ""whistleblow"".... The sequence of events I believe proves this as well as ignoring a sexual harrassment allegation and well documented retaliation. I see a huge issue after reading state and federal guidelines for whistleblowing/sexual harrassment/retaliation and see a large difference here vs a typical Nevada at will termination. I made reasonable attempts with my employer through the proper channels and policy to correct this, and the employer responded negatively and retalitory. I am a realist and am not sure if this is worth fighting and would appreciate that guidance. As far as ""bad faith""... I was moving branches and had nothing to gain from saying anything...i have plenty of proof of my allegations...my goal was to protect future employees and create a fair environment for the ones there. My employer without a doubt in my mind can't prove I reported in bad faith, and I was ultimately let go for whistleblowing and being a liability if these behaviors continued.

I am seeking impartial advice about legal recourse. Do i have a case? Does it fall under whistleblower, retaliation, or sexual harrassment protections?

,legaladvice,"So I've been working on this new app called Wonolo. It allows you to take all sorts of different jobs as an independent contractor.

I did a bunch of jobs at a big pharmacy chain. At most of the jobs the staffing agency that sends me there never informed the store I was coming nor were they aware that such staffing agency even existed and there usually isn't much work to be done.

On most occasions, the managers would send everyone home early. There isn't enough work to be done in a small store for the employees so they generally can't find things for three extra people to do for 6 and a half hours.

Now, in the app, jobs are usually advertised as a flat day rate pay. I have seen jobs advertising an hourly pay, but all the ones I've taken were the flat day rate.

In this case, the job was advertised as $97.50 total pay. Nowhere else was there any indication that pay would be hourly. Generally, the staffing agency had been paying me in full.

Now, the last four jobs that I've completed for them they've begun to pay me less than what was advertised.

This is the latest response I got from Wonolo:

""When you sign up for the app, you accept the Terms of Use that state you are an independent contractor. Please see Section 3.

 

As an independent contractor, Wonoloers may be paid by the hour the same rate, no matter how many hours he or she works; is not covered by the employer’s workers’ compensation insurance, and may shoulder additional tax burdens. 

 

It also states therein that ""Wonolo does not pay a salary or hourly rate but rather facilitates Requestor’s payment of the rate set by the Requestor;""

 

Since the job that you accepted at *staffing agency* had a disclaimer ""We will be validating payment off of the store timesheets."",   this implied payment is in accordance to the amount of time spent on each job.

 

Though it may not have explicitly indicated an hourly pay but it was clear from the disclaimer alone that payment is subject to confirmation or validation, depending on the timesheet information. This would justify accurate payment for a Wonoloer who worked 1 hour against one who worked for 6 hours.

I've always had bad luck with women, and when they come in my life I try everything not to lose them. I've even been often times questioning my sexuality. Maybe I try so hard with keeping people around because these women are my ""beards"" Idk. Some more background too is that I started at a 4 year college then took a year off, after having a mental breakdown and attempting suicide which resulted in a being placed in a pysch ward. A huge issue I have is saying no to people, and just in general being too nice. Also this is in New York.

Not that the background is out of the way. Basically a few years ago this whole nightmare started a few years back, I matched with this really pretty girl on Tinder. We talked for a little bit, and I ended up taking her on a couple dates. She gave me a blowjob (Which I didn't get hard for) and I went down on her. A few months later I got a phone call from her dad and literally my stomach dropped so far when he told me her daughter was underage (15). This happened when I was 22. A couple months later she reached out to me again and apologized. We were talking and this girl is really intelligent. we just kept being friends which was not smart on my part at all. I later went back to college and I started seeing another women who is my now girlfriend and is amazing. But this is the part that's really bad. The underage girl was now 16 by now. She starts this off by telling me ""I want to send you a pic, but I can't"". and me being an idiot I tell her go for it. She sends me an underwear picture. 

This caused the situtation to spiral like crazy. Basically we sent nudes literally all the time while I was dating my girlffriend. I was even sending nudes to guys. (I've talked to my girlfriend about some of this). It was really bad, I didn't realize it but I was kinda grooming her. Which is awful, I just thought I was being nice and we were having fun. This went on for 4 months. It didn't stop until her friend called me up and told me how much of a piece of shit I was being. It took that to make realize, and take a step back. 

I thought that I did enough to protect myself. I deleted all social media and blocked her from my laptop (I have a mac). But not on my phone. Now this girl has contacted just recently a few times. Since quarentine has started maybe 5. (She follows my girlfriend on instagram, so the calls typically come when my girlfriend makes a post. Ususaly I ignore the calls since they're really late at night. But I picked up one, last month and she calling me a sexual predator, and that I was the adult. And really laying into me about it about how much of a garbage person I am.  She called again last night, I picked it up and talked to her. She told me how she learned the grooming and that i groomed her. (which is disgusting). She told me about how she was thinking of messaging my girlfriend about everything. But what I'm getting to is she told me she talked to people and she told me what charges I could be looking at. She said she isn't sure about pressing charges. I want both the girl and I to be at peace. I told her that.

What my question is, is what can I do to protect myself? I've told my best friend everything. I didn't try to sugarcoat anything. He really recommended I stop contact. A

# Pregnancy and relationship

📷

Thankyou to whoever is taking time to read it. Its long but precise enough to help me with some advice.

I had a relationship with my ex for two years and we broke up due to some family issues. After a while he lied to me and it was all for another girl. I started drinking with my friends and one day( July 2019) I met one of my friends friend ABC. (I will keep the name ABC to avoid identity bad mouthing). I kinda liked him and started flirting (even though I wasn't over my ex- my first mistake). ABC look quite disturbed and eventually he shared what was wrong with him. He had financial issues has his Immigration status was going to expire. He was short of 3000$ and I started trusting him so much in few days that I made an arrangement for the money he was short. In a few days he had issues with his roommates and he moved out. I asked him to come to my place. My ex and I share a dog in common and he use to come visit him. So whenever he use to come I asked ABC to sleep outside because I didn't want my ex to think ill of me. In a way I mistreated ABC. One day two of my friends came to see me from far and we went for dinner and it was too late for them to drive home. So I asked them to sleep at mine. They came and ABC thought I slept with one of them which I didn't. He started having character issues with me and meanwhile during that process I started realizing my mistakes and fell In love with him. He started getting abusive day by day, violent, humiliated me in front of his friends, even showed his pe\*\*s out of his pants in front of his friends and asked me to have it if I am too much into sex. I still continued facing all that because of the guilt I had for mistreating him. Me and ABC weren't dating and it was all physical because he wasn't interested In me. Dec 2020 we had unprotected intercourse, and Feb 2020 2nd week I got to know I am pregnant. I was ready to abort it but was waiting for some financial support from back home. mean while I had an ultrasound and got attached to the baby and didn't wanted to end the pregnancy . I told ABC about it and gave him full assurity that he would never even have to pay a penny for the child. But he started calling me names like prostitute, child eater and stuff like that. Now he is forcing me to abort or he will make my life hell. What should I do. I am getting depressed and helpless day by day. He sleeps in my room and I sleep on the stairs. I am just too scared to hear those words again. He even said that he never enjoyed getting physical with me( after 9 months ) and he just did it so I wouldn't go to any other guy. He says I planned pregnancy against his will. I have appoitment proof for abortion, pictures of injuries from his abuse but do not want to get him in trouble because I love him. I do not want to loose my child at any cost. I asked him that I will sign the papers that you won't be liable about anything but he is not listening.

So I’m buying a townhome. Closing date all set and signed by both parties on addendum.  Well, cabinet makers were shutdown for a short time and now it’s changing my closing date from (22nd) to later the following month (02nd). 

They are trying to get me to sign the addendum, and relieve themselves of any thing extra costs associated with me being displaced or my belongings.

They have tried telling me that I should get an Airbnb, hotel and other things that would be coming out of my pocket, as well as a storage facility or pod for temporary storage needs.

The townhome is new construction and they are doing things to get it all ready in time and even asked to sign a zero day walk and they would come fix later.

The sales person/realtor just dumped me after papers were signed and haven’t heard from them, but the others are picking up their slack.

,legaladvice,"So I lived in an apartment in Los Angeles, CA during 2018-2019. My girlfriend was the main signer of the lease, with her mom as a guarantor, and I was on the lease as occupant. The first apartment manager working there was very chill, lenient with the rules. Super nice guy. The parking in the building was paid PER CAR, and open parking, meaning no assigned spots. You paid monthly for your parking pass, and parked anywhere in the garage. The apartment manager gave me a garage gate key, and told me not to worry about paying the extra parking fee. I had never paid this fee, I guess he thought my girlfriend paying for her one spot was enough money spent for the both of us to park there. Like I said, really chill guy. 

The problem arises after we moved out. I had parked in the garage throughout the entire duration of the lease. A situation happened where the original manager was fired, a new manager took over, and corporate managers started heavily managing the building. This was a mess. Everything changed. The living situation became uncomfortable and we even got them to agree to cutting our lease short because of all of the problems we were having there, but we didn't end up moving out early because of the headache. So we stayed throughout the lease duration. 

After we left, everything seemed fine. About a week later, a ludicrous bill comes in for painting fees and overdue parking fees. We contested the painting fees, as we have a walkthrough on video of the manager saying everything looked fine and they even marked down a chart saying there would be minimal fees for screw holes in the wall. The unpaid and overdue parking fees came as a huge confusion. I was told not to worry about it! I was given a parking garage gate key and was never once asked to pay the parking fee while living there!

Now without contacting us much about the bill, they have sent the parking bill to collections, under my girlfriend and her mothers name. They knew the parking bill was because of my car. I was on the lease as an occupant. They have my information. I believe they're specifically going after the stronger party who holds more money and assets on purpose. On top of sending it to collections during a global pandemic, which I suspect is because they're down money on rent because tenants can't pay and they know they can't do anything about that. 

I'm asking for advice on what to do here. Does this bill need to be paid? Is this legal for them to do? They sent it to collections with minimal contact to us, from my understanding.
