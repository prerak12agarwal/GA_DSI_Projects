,StonerPhilosophy,"I've been a rather heavy smoker for 6-7 years now. I've *quit* multiple times. Usually because tolerance and money. Obviously as tolerance goes up, weed stops being worth the money. 

I've quit for 4+ months straight probably 2 or 3 times with countless other *breaks* lasting around a month. Even the times I've quit for 4+ months, that first time back is just not the same. Its *strong* and of course I get blasted but its not exciting or even fun like it used to be. Its just relaxing at best. 

Sometimes I think its because I smoke alone now whereas I used to smoke with friends. But even back then, I smoked alone all the time and still felt excited and exuberant by it. It brought me joy and happiness. Every day when I got home from the dinner shift at work, I was so excited to come home to a couple bowls. 

Now, I come home from work and its like its obligatory. Like I don't even have a choice. I *want* to smoke but only because its just what I do and offers a small bit of relief/relaxation. 

Also, dab pens.. does anyone else feel like the convenience of dab pens has ruined the experience? First off, my tolerance can go from 0 to 100 in 2-3 days with a dab pen. I can go from ""blasted on the first hit"" to burning 1/5th of the cart in 15 minutes and barely feeling buzzed just a couple days later. Also, coming down within 30-45 minutes. 

Back when I smoked only herb and had to sneak, I could only smoke at most twice a day as well as smoking lower quantities at once. Id be stoned as hell for 3-5 hours. And I always felt like doing stuff. Now, I smoke, I eat, and I take a nap at 10:30am. Wake up at 11:30, take more pen hits, and repeat. I can easily spend $300+ a month between pens and bud, and not even enjoy it that much. But here's the worst part, I still enjoy it more than being sober. 

At this point, all weed does for me is helps me sleep and helps me to be content with my life. When I'm sober, I can't help but to think of my regrets and my shortcomings. As well as obsessing over the way my life used to be. I miss my old friends and easier days. I miss that special feeling weed used to give me that I just can't get anymore. 

Weed has given me some of my best nights, days, and many of my favorite memories. Everything else in my life has either fallen apart entirely or at least degraded. I was really hoping weed could be the one thing in my life that was consistent and could still give me everything I want from it. 

I'm sorry that this post was kind of depressing. Its just life man. Sometimes shit gets real and that's kinda what this is about.

,StonerPhilosophy,"Also, I feel like thoughts come from the environment. They don't originate in our minds but are only translations of the external environment.

Right? 

Okay for example, my brain didn't come up with the concept of warmth. Instead, my body experienced warmth externally and designed a way to communicate it to other members of the species (and subconsciously to other parts of the body). The brain is just one of many translators. So that would mean that whatever causes me warmth is the actual ""thought"". Memory is only used to retrieve a thought so it can be translated when needed. So, I can still think about a flame (from memory) without actually being burned, but for two reasons only: because I've previously experienced a burn, or because someone translated the experience of a burn (which could have been translated to them by another person). Either way, the thought of a burn never originates with an actual person or entity, but with THE external source of ""warmth"" that's been translated throughout time.

That would mean that thoughts are all around us, hiding in each and every atom of experience, just waiting to be channeled through this highly complex instrument we call bodies.

My dealer text saying ""due to covid19 I am now delivering""
I thought, alright sweet I can get more here cause he will call to my door therefore taking all the risk.
See drugs are illegal in the UK my friends...
And I live in the smallest part in the arse hole of nowhere.
So the supply can dry up very quickly sometimes.
.
.
.
So I bought £100 worth.
BRO... It was so suspicious.
I am surprised the police are not putting my door through to raid me.
And I live in a fucking cul de sac dead end...
Do you think anyone else in my immediate neighbourhood buys drugs?!
No. Now.. They suspish.. And I'm suspish.
Fucking mint.
.
.
So I smoked the rest of my old stuff, brilliant.
Yesterday....
I made firecrackers. I smoked 6 joints. I took 13 bong rips. I kid you not. Guys I should have almost fucking died yesterday.
But I didn't get high.
Now this weed... Its brown. Its dry. There's no stickiness. No crystals. I'm dead ass praying this is a strain and it'll be good.
Nothing.
My vape arrived and I excitedly charged it up. Excited to taste the different flavours I read about here. Remember, shits illegal class B drug over here. Fs. Dickheads. Anyway...
I cannot find the words to describe this experience but I will try...
The vape hit 350f. It was ready. I took a huge draw closed my eyes and felt my lungs shrivel to raises while everythibg the smoke hit withered and died and began to rot. I blew it out and I coughed for a solid 20 minutes. I am spitting salvia in the sink. I have tears running down my fucking face. I am highly concerned that I am gonna have a stroke or brain aneurysm from coughing. I am fucking SPAZZING out. I am freaking out. I'm about to scream for help, well I would, if I wasn't drowning in salvia while trying not to vomit. 
Firstly the harshness of the smoke was like sandpaper rubbing salt over a skinned knee. Fuck me that has cut years off my life. The smell was what I truly do imagine the devil's arse hole to smell like after burning diahorrea. The taste was also what I imagine that to be. 
I was literally crying.
I truly believed that after 1 month of daily smoking that my tolerance had got to that level.
And I'd just wasted £22 on a horrible vape. 
What the fuck.
I thought, well... Ill ask reddit. Guys said nah keep smoking you'll get high.
Guys I did not even get a slight tingle.
I am now freaking out thinking I am fucking more tolerant to weed than snoop dog?! After one month?!
Am I a fucking GOD?!
.
.
So I made more firecrackers this morning. I thought, maybe I fucked up the decarb. I'll try again. Now bear in mind I have lodged a formal complaint with my dealer stating that ""this weed couldn't get a baby high"". I don't think he's gonna reply or do shit about it but yano it's the principle of the matter sometimes. I put about 2g in ONE cracker. I ate it on an empty stomach.
5 HOURS LATER... NOTHING.
Alright that's me, I'm fucked. Tolerance break. Fuck sake. Now all the way through this my best friend who has been smoking daily for 6 years is texting me and she's high as a kite on 1 Blunt and I'm thinking yup. My tolerance break is gonna need to be about 5 years. What the fuck is wrong with me. This was literally devestating to me. I found this to help me with migraines and mental health after my mom died. And now I'm immune.
But, my guardian angel looked down on me (they've appeared a lot in my life weirdly)
My boyfriends friend got a delivery.
The following occured:
BF: is it any good?
FR: Well it's not overly strong, but it got me high.
I wish I could highlight those words

On 28th May, 2020 Late President Donald Trump declared that Coronavirus was actually a Chinese army's order execution called ""Forbidden City"" to artificially accelerate the hate towards the People's Republic of China from the world so they can isolate themselves more and more and become self dependent cutting all ties with the world. The remaining target population of 40% will survive and try to live together with Martians?

China's media claims that the opening of ozone layer in the months of January to March was actually a loophole in USA's Space Force's sensors and that NASA's presence at Mars has triggered a series of interplanetary One Sided political decisions that has brought them into a position where they would rather separate themselves from the world in order to survive against an alien threat. By doing this, they feel they can exchange information with Martians and allow the first refugees. Obviously, the refugees were trained soldiers which are being sent to us to colonize our planet. China further claims Forbidden City's secondary objective of contacting Martians came out positive. They say it's a success for Chinese Army and deserves to make a Planetary decision on behalf of earth for surviving guides of humanity. China published a tableau explaining the conversion of Project Forbidden City into a Policy. 


Elon Musk starts his talk, ""It's all a sham as we all know. Donald was onto something for months and we ignored all his suspicions. We need to act.

,StonerPhilosophy,"I know that this may not be a relevant question or post for this thread, but I figure there are a lot of stoners, like myself, here who struggle with family and friends ostracizing us because of our weed usage. 

My question is what do you have to do to not feel like a total waste of a person if you smoke weed? 

I smoke legally in my state because I have a medical card. I go to college at the University of Oklahoma, the school I’ve always wanted to go to. Before going to this school, I joined the military and deployed as well. I got out of the military to get my degree. I pay my bills. I’m not in debt other than my car payment. I don’t have a wife or kids. I treat people around me with respect or at least I try to. 

I’m staying with family because of the virus right now so my living situation is just kinda weird. I’m sure others can relate... but my older brother smelled weed yesterday and basically told me there’s something wrong with me for smoking weed. I don’t really want to go too deep into it. All I know is that I wasn’t expecting such a negative response from my brother. Not saying I expected him to be happy, which is why I don’t tell people around me I’m a stoner. I just don’t want to deal with experiences like the one I had with my brother all of the time. 

Anyways, the point I’m trying to make is that I don’t have a lot of support when it comes to smoking weed. I love weed but dealing with shit like stereotypes or people assuming there’s something wrong with you for liking it is sometimes more than I can handle by myself. 

Also, Confrontations while high are the worst thing ever.",t2_4bduf1ec,False,,0,False,Dealing with stereotypes,[],r/StonerPhilosophy,False,,,0,False,t3_gadymw,False,dark,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588211365.0,text,,,,text,self.StonerPhilosophy,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that this may not be a relevant question or post for this thread, but I figure there are a lot of stoners, like myself, here who struggle with family and friends ostracizing us because of our weed usage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is what do you have to do to not feel like a total waste of a person if you smoke weed? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smoke legally in my state because I have a medical card. I go to college at the University of Oklahoma, the school I’ve always wanted to go to. Before going to this school, I joined the military and deployed as well. I got out of the military to get my degree. I pay my bills. I’m not in debt other than my car payment. I don’t have a wife or kids. I treat people around me with respect or at least I try to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m staying with family because of the virus right now so my living situation is just kinda weird. I’m sure others can relate... but my older brother smelled weed yesterday and basically told me there’s something wrong with me for smoking weed. I don’t really want to go too deep into it. All I know is that I wasn’t expecting such a negative response from my brother. Not saying I expected him to be happy, which is why I don’t tell people around me I’m a stoner. I just don’t want to deal with experiences like the one I had with my brother all of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the point I’m trying to make is that I don’t have a lot of support when it comes to smoking weed. I love weed but dealing with shit like stereotypes or people assuming there’s something wrong with you for liking it is sometimes more than I can handle by myself. &lt;/p&gt;

,StonerPhilosophy,"I've been pondering on a discussion under another post on this sub for a little while. it was titled: **What is surprising is not that there is something rather than nothing. It's that this something is highly ordered and not just a chaotic mess. What are the odds?** In case anyone wanted to refer back to it. Pretty thought provoking discussion.

Anyway inspired by that post and by The Midnight Gospel on Netflix I expanded a bit on my own view of the nature of reality it goes like this. In order for anything to emerge as reality the possibility must be inherently present as a part of the nature of pre-reality itself.

Our understanding of reality is based on certain fundamental elements like time, space, energy, and matter. Before each of these things can even emerge, the *possibility* for them to emerge must be an inherent part of pre-reality. If it was not so, it would never have occurred at all. Seems obvious. If it was impossible for this reality to take the shape it has, reality would never have taken this shape. I'll call this the Tao. The Tao is the potential of all things to emerge from pre-existence. If we look at any phenomena that emerged as a result of this structure of reality, it shares the common source of the Tao which is nothingness but with *possibility*. What this seems to indicate is it is by design. By that I mean the possibility effectively *is* design because it’s a *specific* possibility. It’s *this* reality. If you found the blueprint or schematic for reality lying around somewhere you would have to conclude it is by design right? I posit the Tao must contain within it the blueprint or schematic for reality in the form of potential which is specific possibility. The Tao disallows the impossible and in so doing designs a specific reality.

The opposing theory would be that this is all random. Chaos that over time stabilized into specific form but that doesn’t address A. How/why the chaos can even occur to begin with and B. Why order can emerge from chaos. The possibility for order *must* be present before the chaos even began. No matter how far back you trace it in terms of causality this seems inescapable.

The impossible by definition is that which cannot occur, not because we do not understand it but because it is not within the parameters of either reality or pre-reality ie. no potential. The possible is that which has the potential to occur. All we know must have been possible in order for it to have ever occurred. If it is possible it must have been possible all along; it doesn't seem coherent that what was impossible should change to become possible (that would simply make it possible all along), or vice versa.",t2_tz1xc,False,,0,False,Possibility effectively is design because it’s a specific possibility,[],r/StonerPhilosophy,False,,,0,False,t3_g9i5wj,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,1588872340.0,,[],{},,True,,1588084923.0,text,,,,text,self.StonerPhilosophy,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been pondering on a discussion under another post on this sub for a little while. it was titled: &lt;strong&gt;What is surprising is not that there is something rather than nothing.

Wouldn't that be almost be like a state of death? A state where you cannot learn anything new at all. A state where you always experience every possible thing simultaneously, but none of those things change in your perception because your perception is equally infinite. 

Wouldn't infinity from the perspective of such an entity seem completely static? Unmoving? Unchanging? It would almost seem like a trap or a prison, right? Theologians even use the term ""Immutable"" which means ""unchanging over time or unable to be changed"". If you can only experience everything simultaneously, that really does seem like a form of death. To be unable to be surprised? To be unable to be different?

So maybe the solution to that problem would be for the entity to limit themselves intentionally? To limit their own perception.

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;#39;t that be almost be like a state of death? A state where you cannot learn anything new at all. A state where you always experience every possible thing simultaneously, but none of those things change in your perception because your perception is equally infinite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;#39;t infinity from the perspective of such an entity seem completely static? Unmoving? Unchanging? It would almost seem like a trap or a prison, right? Theologians even use the term &amp;quot;Immutable&amp;quot; which means &amp;quot;unchanging over time or unable to be changed&amp;quot;. If you can only experience everything simultaneously, that really does seem like a form of death. To be unable to be surprised? To be unable to be different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe the solution to that problem would be for the entity to limit themselves intentionally? To limit their own perception. The Buddhists say we are all god, experiencing ourself from different perspectives. Is this what they mean? That the universe a sort of dream?&lt;/p&gt;

Our ego mixed with social and cultural conditioning gives us the illusion of separation. But really, we’re all just one thing. The unified field of consciousness theory is true. On the highest level, there’s the whole. Where we all know everything is one and experience everything as one. But then there are the lower levels. The lower you go, the more separate everything seems to be. But it still is all one thing. The amount of matter, energy, etc. that’s apart of the whole doesn’t change at all, it just gets converted into a different form sometimes and if it changes size, other matter or energy, usually air and dust and always light fills in the space around it. But the amount of everything that’s a part of the whole always stays the same. Where have we seen that before? Where have we seen the illusion of separation become more and more prevalent the lower you go? Math. Or more specifically, fractions.

,StonerPhilosophy,"This is kind of hard to explain, so I’ll give an example. 

I just had someone tell me that they can feel their heart drop to their feet the first time someone says “I love you” to them. I think this is a great example of giving form to something formless. The only “real” or external experience is hearing the words “I love you,” but that’ll trigger some internal experience for *just you.* 

I believe that we all have similar internal reactions to common external experiences, but I think it’s somewhat possible to manifest those internal experiences differently by giving them form. Purposefully or accidentally. Like if you always say “taking tests twists my stomach in knots,” I believe you’re more likely to experience that feeling during tests because you believe you will and you’ve given form to an internal reaction. A different person with test anxiety might feel a similar way, but if they don’t label it “twists my stomach in knots” then they probably won’t feel it to that extent. 

On the other hand, maybe sometimes we completely make stuff up without actually experiencing it, but by making it real to us, you can then experience it. For example, say your grandma died and a while later you see her favorite animal, a raccoon. You start to imagine that this raccoon is actually your grandma communicating to you so you just have a conversation with it. Clearly your grandma isn’t ACTUALLY talking through the raccoon but you pretend it is. Later in life every time you see a raccoon it reminds you of your grandma and you feel a closeness to her.

,StonerPhilosophy,"
Descartes was wrong, there is no psychological entity with an identity. He only chose to think that.

It is only the artificial ego that suffers. The man who has transcended his false “me” no longer identifies himself with his suffering.

Outside of strictly practical, technical matters, the presence and action of choice indicates confusion and subtle bias: an individual who perceives a given situation in an unbiased manner, without distortion, and therefore with complete awareness, will immediately, naturally, act according to this awareness – the action will be the manifestation and result of this awareness, rather than the result of choice. Such action (and quality of mind) is inherently without conflict.

For true choicelessness to be realized, choice – implicit or explicit – has to simply, irrevocably, stop; however, this ceasing of choice is not the result of decision-making, but I’m implying the ceasing of the functioning of the chooser or self as a psychological entity.

Such a state might be approached through inquiry based on total attentiveness: identity is then dissolved in complete, all-encompassing attention. Therefore, choiceless awareness is a natural attribute of non-self-centered perception, which he called ""observation without the observer""

Freedom is found in the choiceless awareness of our daily existence and activity.

,StonerPhilosophy,"I've always been an animal lover so I could never really accept the concept of animals being less than humans. I know there's an obvious difference between at least the intelligence of humans vs other animals, because if there wasn't we'd likely see apes building structures or some other animal doing a human behavior. However, people like to use the intelligence level of a species to determine its value and hierarchy relative to other species, and this seems unfair. Why should intelligence be the thing that determines a specie's significance? Could it be because that's the thing humans have above others? For example if we were to use the ability to fly as the deciding factor, birds, bats, and many species of bugs would be labeled as superior to humans and even other mammals. Or if we were to use emotional complexity as the variable here, orcas would be superior, despite a small percentage of people believing animals have no emotions whatsoever. 

Emotions to me are just an aspect of the ego. The ego is connected to our body, human and non, and therefore we all have emotions. I'm just throwing out ideas at this point but it would seem that the ego is here to act as a sort of protector or guardian for our body. Without it, we would lack the drive to seek out food, care for our bodily needs, or even the essential aspect of self preservation. Perhaps there's another thing connected to the body and/or ego, and I can't quite find a name for it, but it would be the part of our consciousness that's left after an ego death or the part we really tune in on and listen to while tripping. 

It's definitely separate from the ego, and I know this because of my own experience with psychedelics. I could be vibing on acid or something completely in my own world, but at least for me if I see another person while I'm in that state my fight or flight (ego) kicks in and snaps me back to reality so I can either pretend I'm sober or find a more secluded spot to trip. I haven't experienced ego death but it's definitely something I want to try when I know I can let go of my ego without worrying about the well-being of my body/ego. Our body is just a vessel for our consciousness and it's guarded by our ego because frankly we'd probably die if survival was a responsibility of our consciousness. In fact I know from personal experiences that if I didn't have an ego to harbour all those thoughts and behaviors we call human nature, I would have already decided living is too much of a challenge to make any rewards worth while. Fortunately my ego is there acting as a safety net for those bad trips or especially dark days, and once I've worked my way out or through those emotional ruts, every time I find my mind has changed and I rediscover my reason for living. 

I tripped for my first time on acid earlier today on 120ug, and had the most amazing experience. My last trip had been a particularly intense and pretty bad experience on 3g of shrooms, which left me with a lot of self hate I hadn't realized I had been carrying for years. (It's important to note for those anti-drug people that my 'self hate' wasn't created by my trip, it was merely brought to light for me to then fully realize its existence) This last trip I feel has finally allowed me to leave some of that behind, and I have to say if I hadn't had that bad trip before to really expose my flaws to myself, I definitely would not of been able to work through them. I don't believe however I've worked through all my problems, and I'll likely find myself with the same self-deprecating thoughts after this trip, but even so, I already feel like I've worked through some of it. If anything it's at least put me on the path to a more complete and self-loving self, and I have both my good and bad trips to thank for that. 

I think we underappreciate bad trips. Sure they're traumatic and ugly but they play a vital role in our exploration of our own consciousness. It's comparable in a way to how we have to experience bad days to fully appreciate good ones. In short, our bad trips allow us to have even better trips. 

Now to relate that rant back to animals, perhaps they have all the same layering of consciousness that humans do: a body, an ego, and something above that. Perhaps it's the quality of intelligence that we humans love to boast about that allows us to wonder beyond the concerns of the ego. We are likely if not the only species, at least one of the few that contemplates our own existence. We know animals probably don't question their existence because I'm pretty sure we'd all agree a cat is perfectly content laying in a sunny window all day, while sitting for too long for a human or extremely intelligent animal would quickly become boring and even unbearable. We have to have a constant source of stimulation that while is shared with other intelligent species, just isn't shared with the same intensity. To continue the cat example, we can't keep a cat in a room with no stimulation and expect that cat to stay content. That cat would require something like birds on a feeder to watch or toys to play with, just to name a couple examples. We like every species need some level of enrichment, but a cat's required level is lower than a humans. That doesn't make a cat's life any less valuable than a human's, it just means we have more of a particular quality, a quality no more important than the ability to fly for example. 

By trying to explain this I ended up ranting a bit, but I hope this is a message at least one other person can appreciate and maybe even learn from. If anything, perhaps it's just a different perspective to consider.

,StonerPhilosophy,"String theory suggests there are at least 10 dimensions. Some say 11, some say 26, but superstring theory says 10. There’s videos about it on YouTube but I’m not allowed to link them here. I’d like to discuss the implications of this theory on us and the spirit world. I think it actually fits rather nicely and here’s why. I have to give a quick overview of the dimensions in order to do so, though.

* **0th Dimension:** A single point of indeterminate size.

* **1st Dimension:** A line between any two 0d points, containing an infinite number of 0d points in between.

* **2nd Dimension:** A single 1d line doesn’t contain all possible 0d points, so the 2nd dimension is a plane of many 1d lines.

* **3rd Dimension:** Many 2d planes make a 3d space. You understand this one.

* **4th Dimension:** 3d space across a duration makes a 4d spacetime or “worldline”. Can be thought of as time, but according to physics anti-time is just as valid as forward/normal time, it’s just the particles we’re made of can only move forward in 4d spacetime.

* **5th Dimension:** Many 4d worldlines (like 1d lines) make a 5d “probability space” (like a 2d plane). You can think of this as branches coming off our current timeline based on our choices, the choices of others, etc. Any option you might’ve taken is just as real as the option you took in the 5th dimension.

* **6th Dimension:** Many 5d probability spaces or planes make a 6d “phase space”, which holds all possible outcomes for a unique universe like ours with the same start conditions.

* **7th Dimensions:** Many 6d phase spaces representing different unique universes and all their possible outcomes create a 7d “line”.

* **8th Dimension:** Many 7d lines create an 8d “phase plane, “ representing all possible universes with all possible outcomes.

* **9th Dimension:** Many 8d phase planes doesn’t make sense because it’s already representing every possible universe, so the 9th dimension is an “information space.” It’s not physical. But like the 3rd, it adds “depth” to the phase *plane* allowing a theoretical 9d traveler to jump quickly from place to place in the 8th dimension. Instead of traveling in a line through the 8th dimension, I can fold it into the 9th dimension and get there instantly just like a wormhole.

* **10th Dimension:** A big timeless “everything” where the 9th dimension resides, because a line of multiple information spaces doesn’t make sense. Perhaps information space has “duration” and that is the 10th dimension, but that makes my brain hurt. Basically, my understanding is the math says we should stop here.

Now, what does this all mean for us and for spirits?

It is my opinion that we are 7 dimensional spirits, traveling through 8 dimensional “spacetime,” bounded by 9 dimensional information space. Our bodies are 3 dimensional objects traveling through 4 dimensional spacetime, bounded by a 5 dimensional probability space.

Photons take time to hit our eyes, so everything you see is actually a 2d projection by your brain of something that happened in the past, whether the extremely recent past (right in front of you) or the distant past (a star). This is an effect of occupying 4d spacetime within a 5d probability plane.

Imagine your body from birth to death, laid out as one creature kinda like a worm that’s a baby at one end and an old person at the other. Now take a single slice of that worm-like creature - that’s what our bodies look like in the 4th dimension. We, as 3d bodies, experience this as duration.

These 4d worldlines have different branching possibilities, depending on our choices and other things we don’t control. We, as 3d observers of 4d spacetime, are simultaneously navigating a 5d probability space.

This 5d probability space is bounded by a 6d phase space, which holds all the possible outcomes for our unique universe. We can then make a line of different unique universes (7d), but that doesn’t cover all unique universes - for that we make an 8d plane. Now we have a plane of all possible unique universes (each with all of their possible outcomes). So say I am traveling through the 8th dimension and I want to travel from one point in the plane to another very quickly. I can jump into the 9th dimension, which because all physical matter is accounted for already, is purely informational, or perhaps “spiritual.”

Much like our bodies are 3d slices of 4d entities navigating through 5d probability space (experienced as 3d space + time), spirits are 7d entities navigating through an 8d phase plane. Also a lot like man, they may experience themselves as 6d slices of a 7d worm-like creature. As man is bound to the 3rd dimension by the 4th, spirit is bound to the 6th dimension by the 7th. This is why they seem to have control over our universe, but yet they cannot break any laws of physics or do anything that the conditions of our universe would not permit.

If you read all of it I really appreciate it. I’d love to hear any and all of your thoughts.",t2_27ncjivz,False,,0,False,The 10 dimensions of physics and their implications on us and the spirit world,[],r/StonerPhilosophy,False,,,0,False,t3_fxhab3,False,dark,1.0,,public,11,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,11,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1586417109.0,text,,,,text,self.StonerPhilosophy,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;String theory suggests there are at least 10 dimensions. Some say 11, some say 26, but superstring theory says 10. There’s videos about it on YouTube but I’m not allowed to link them here. I’d like to discuss the implications of this theory on us and the spirit world. I think it actually fits rather nicely and here’s why. I have to give a quick overview of the dimensions in order to do so, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0th Dimension:&lt;/strong&gt; A single point of indeterminate size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Dimension:&lt;/strong&gt; A line between any two 0d points, containing an infinite number of 0d points in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Dimension:&lt;/strong&gt; A single 1d line doesn’t contain all possible 0d points, so the 2nd dimension is a plane of many 1d lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd Dimension:&lt;/strong&gt; Many 2d planes make a 3d space. You understand this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4th Dimension:&lt;/strong&gt; 3d space across a duration makes a 4d spacetime or “worldline”. Can be thought of as time, but according to physics anti-time is just as valid as forward/normal time, it’s just the particles we’re made of can only move forward in 4d spacetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5th Dimension:&lt;/strong&gt; Many 4d worldlines (like 1d lines) make a 5d “probability space” (like a 2d plane). You can think of this as branches coming off our current timeline based on our choices, the choices of others, etc. Any option you might’ve taken is just as real as the option you took in the 5th dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6th Dimension:&lt;/strong&gt; Many 5d probability spaces or planes make a 6d “phase space”, which holds all possible outcomes for a unique universe like ours with the same start conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7th Dimensions:&lt;/strong&gt; Many 6d phase spaces representing different unique universes and all their possible outcomes create a 7d “line”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8th Dimension:&lt;/strong&gt; Many 7d lines create an 8d “phase plane, “ representing all possible universes with all possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9th Dimension:&lt;/strong&gt; Many 8d phase planes doesn’t make sense because it’s already representing every possible universe, so the 9th dimension is an “information space.” It’s not physical. But like the 3rd, it adds “depth” to the phase &lt;em&gt;plane&lt;/em&gt; allowing a theoretical 9d traveler to jump quickly from place to place in the 8th dimension. Instead of traveling in a line through the 8th dimension, I can fold it into the 9th dimension and get there instantly just like a wormhole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10th Dimension:&lt;/strong&gt; A big timeless “everything” where the 9th dimension resides, because a line of multiple information spaces doesn’t make sense. Perhaps information space has “duration” and that is the 10th dimension, but that makes my brain hurt. Basically, my understanding is the math says we should stop here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what does this all mean for us and for spirits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my opinion that we are 7 dimensional spirits, traveling through 8 dimensional “spacetime,” bounded by 9 dimensional information space. Our bodies are 3 dimensional objects traveling through 4 dimensional spacetime, bounded by a 5 dimensional probability space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photons take time to hit our eyes, so everything you see is actually a 2d projection by your brain of something that happened in the past, whether the extremely recent past (right in front of you) or the distant past (a star). This is an effect of occupying 4d spacetime within a 5d probability plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine your body from birth to death, laid out as one creature kinda like a worm that’s a baby at one end and an old person at the other. Now take a single slice of that worm-like creature - that’s what our bodies look like in the 4th dimension. We, as 3d bodies, experience this as duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 4d worldlines have different branching possibilities, depending on our choices and other things we don’t control. We, as 3d observers of 4d spacetime, are simultaneously navigating a 5d probability space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 5d probability space is bounded by a 6d phase space, which holds all the possible outcomes for our unique universe. We can then make a line of different unique universes (7d), but that doesn’t cover all unique universes - for that we make an 8d plane. Now we have a plane of all possible unique universes (each with all of their possible outcomes). So say I am traveling through the 8th dimension and I want to travel from one point in the plane to another very quickly. I can jump into the 9th dimension, which because all physical matter is accounted for already, is purely informational, or perhaps “spiritual.”&lt;/p&gt;

All I do all day is smoke weed, eat and watch tv shows and I’m starting to get bummed out about that. I wanted to decrease a little how much I smoke because where I live weed is ilegal, so unless you’re really rich you can only buy shitty weed that is probably mixed with a bunch of shit (we call that prensado here in Brazil), so I can’t really rely on the quality of what I’m consuming, which is probably why i start to feel bad if I smoke too frequently, like start to loose grip of reality and stuff like that. But being quarantined and bored, smoking is the best part of the day, so it’s hard to quit. 
Just for information I’m a girl, and being hungry all the time because of weed and boredom is making me eat too much and I feel bad about that, having self esteem issues and not wanting to face eating disorders because of that shit.

,StonerPhilosophy,"I have been thinking a lot lately. And I one idea that has formed around my mind is kind of like a philosophical theory. But I don't what to label it or call it. So here it goes :

IT'S NOT ANYONE'S FAULT

Like it says, it's no one's fault. When you look at everyone around you. We all have our justifications, we all have made mistakes, we all have fucked up once or more. We are humans and not perfect gods. Everyone has their own justification. The kid who got bullied and the kid who bullied him. The murderer has one too. And I'm not justifying anyone or their actions. I'm just saying that everyone has a perspective. And when you look at this world, you'll realize how everything is just relative. Murder are wrong because in human society human life if considered valuable and taking that away from someone is a crime. If the society had different values, the criteria for classifying something as a crime would've been different. And I'm saying all this now but that won't be the same way I'd react if someone whom I love gets murdered. I would be sad and angry at the murderer. I would curse him all my life, wishing for horrible things to happen to him. 

Think about it, you are the most realest thing you have in this world. We all could be living in a simulation and we'd have no idea. And maybe you're brain might just be a chip that the simulation runners have made but you're experiences, thoughts, feelings, ideas, etc are as real as it gets. There is no other option. You is the only thing you can trust and the only thing you truly have. And the past and future versions of you don't exist. That narrows is down to the present you. Everything else in this world i.e, other peoples' experiences, thoughts, etc can't be felt by you. Those things will never be as real as your own reality. 

Everyone acts according to their own will. Even when they decide to listen to others and take their advice. And the reason why I said it's not anyone's fault is because nothing truly matters in this world. But we have created relative meaning to survive. To escape the absurdity of this world. And it's positive. Why? Better positive than negative right? And that is why destruction is usually conceived as wrong (murder). And the acts classified as crimes have changed as we became more complex.

But I can't help feel bad for everything. Humans, animals, birds, and everything else. We are in this pool of suffering called life and we have to survive. I feel bad for myself and for everyone else. When I look at people do stuff and for a second (I think this is what the philosopher Sartre calls as absurdity) I notice how crazy we all look doing ordinary stuff. How it's all just to have meaning. To escape insanity. Someone puts on chemicals on their face called make up to look pretty, someone is out there crying at 2 a.m on their bed, someone out their is cheating, someone out there is about to die in a few seconds and they don't know it. Science itself feels like humanities best attempt to make meaning out of this world. 

Ever since I've been unable to blame someone. Unable to say that someone needs to die because of their horrible mistake. I just think, they're alive like me or any other organism just trying to get by. No one can be 100% right and no one can be 100% wrong all of the time. These were my thoughts, and is in no way trying to preach people and tell everyone how to live. After all, these are just my thoughts. 

For those whom I might have induced an existential crisis. I apologize. Live according to your own ideas, even if they are wrong you can hold yourself responsible if something goes wrong and be proud of yourself if everything goes right.

Ignore the title, it's just a lyric I love from a Russian song.",t2_4mtta3t7,False,,0,False,Who are we if not children?,[],r/StonerPhilosophy,False,,,0,False,t3_ftgr9u,False,dark,0.78,,public,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1585834711.0,text,,,,text,self.StonerPhilosophy,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking a lot lately. And I one idea that has formed around my mind is kind of like a philosophical theory. But I don&amp;#39;t what to label it or call it. So here it goes :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT&amp;#39;S NOT ANYONE&amp;#39;S FAULT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like it says, it&amp;#39;s no one&amp;#39;s fault. When you look at everyone around you. We all have our justifications, we all have made mistakes, we all have fucked up once or more. We are humans and not perfect gods. Everyone has their own justification. The kid who got bullied and the kid who bullied him. The murderer has one too. And I&amp;#39;m not justifying anyone or their actions. I&amp;#39;m just saying that everyone has a perspective. And when you look at this world, you&amp;#39;ll realize how everything is just relative. Murder are wrong because in human society human life if considered valuable and taking that away from someone is a crime. If the society had different values, the criteria for classifying something as a crime would&amp;#39;ve been different. And I&amp;#39;m saying all this now but that won&amp;#39;t be the same way I&amp;#39;d react if someone whom I love gets murdered. I would be sad and angry at the murderer. I would curse him all my life, wishing for horrible things to happen to him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it, you are the most realest thing you have in this world. We all could be living in a simulation and we&amp;#39;d have no idea. And maybe you&amp;#39;re brain might just be a chip that the simulation runners have made but you&amp;#39;re experiences, thoughts, feelings, ideas, etc are as real as it gets. There is no other option. You is the only thing you can trust and the only thing you truly have. And the past and future versions of you don&amp;#39;t exist. That narrows is down to the present you. Everything else in this world i.e, other peoples&amp;#39; experiences, thoughts, etc can&amp;#39;t be felt by you. Those things will never be as real as your own reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone acts according to their own will. Even when they decide to listen to others and take their advice. And the reason why I said it&amp;#39;s not anyone&amp;#39;s fault is because nothing truly matters in this world. But we have created relative meaning to survive. To escape the absurdity of this world. And it&amp;#39;s positive. Why? Better positive than negative right? And that is why destruction is usually conceived as wrong (murder). And the acts classified as crimes have changed as we became more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t help feel bad for everything. Humans, animals, birds, and everything else. We are in this pool of suffering called life and we have to survive. I feel bad for myself and for everyone else. When I look at people do stuff and for a second (I think this is what the philosopher Sartre calls as absurdity) I notice how crazy we all look doing ordinary stuff. How it&amp;#39;s all just to have meaning. To escape insanity. Someone puts on chemicals on their face called make up to look pretty, someone is out there crying at 2 a.m on their bed, someone out their is cheating, someone out there is about to die in a few seconds and they don&amp;#39;t know it. Science itself feels like humanities best attempt to make meaning out of this world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I&amp;#39;ve been unable to blame someone. Unable to say that someone needs to die because of their horrible mistake. I just think, they&amp;#39;re alive like me or any other organism just trying to get by. No one can be 100% right and no one can be 100% wrong all of the time.

,StonerPhilosophy,"&gt;  break you so that you will heal stronger as a person.

What I mean by this specifically is Lets say you love someone, and that person doesn't want to see you again. the problem is you start associating people's faces with her, so you can't get her out of your head. You see people that look like her on the street and wonder...is that her? then you move closer and realize it isn't. This happens multiple times for years.

However this is a game. So you have a love for the game (your first love) and the game disc breaks and all copies are sold out, so you can never play it again. But this is a much better scenario because it's completely separate from people. Therefore you won't be bothered  when you look at other people since you didn't fall in love with a person, but a game or the game's idea/ideals. You can switch off a game to get it out of your head, not so easy with a person. 

So in a way it's better for your first love to be an object rather than a person, because you can get rid of or ""unhook"" the game's presence in reality much easier than a person. This is of course assuming most people are the type of person that will always think of their first love when they think of a person, or something like that.

DMT could be something similar but instead it gets memories from some other intelligent life form... something more otherworldly, hence why people usually have DMT aliens. Psilocybin could do something similar but it's more of like the right brain, more emotional. Of course that would mean DMT would have an opposite, and Ima just say its salvia because how could we possibly understand a completely different emotional pattern from an organism who is completely different from us(physically probably affects mentality) hence why people usually have such chaotic salvia trips. But anyway, psychedelics are allowing us to learn truths from another things own experiences, which we can use to better our own life.

When the the conscience in the psychedelics is in our bodies, it wants to see how our world is that's why our eyes dilate, the visuals we get is the conscious trying to place shapes and objects where they think its supposed to go(like how our own eyes can deceive us but its another conscience thing to figure a strange world). When we trip and go about our lives the conscience plays a factor in making a good or bad trip based on how you plan on letting it enjoy its time stimulated?(idk what you would call a temporary resuscitate of a conscience, I guess we don't have a word for that, maybe trip?

Are most people like me, not cleaning their pipe at all if ita cheap or if they aren&amp;#39;t constantly using it? Lol I guess I&amp;#39;d feel a little less mortified if I knew that a lot of other people have made this same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

""

It is important to consider evolution when determining upon epistemological origins regarding the human capacity for objective truth. The relationship between human perception and reality from an evolutionary standpoint is necessarily a relationship between a behavioural response and the provisional elements of reality insofar as is immediately relevant to the subject. In other words, the elements of the environment – more specifically the subset of the environment pertaining to the elements of the immediate reality of the subject – that contribute to the more “successful” existence (evolutionarily speaking) of the subject is the determining cause, and nature, of perception. Thus, the limits of human capacity for understanding objective reality must account for being limited to perceiving that which has been of more relative necessity. Hence the existentialist claim of truth being imperceptible. However, the entirety of a local objective reality could, theoretically speaking, be entirely perceivable by an ultimately *infinitely* evolved being within the confines of an accessible reality: as within the parameters of an infinite evolution all of objective reality will have revealed herself via the provision of all necessary heuristics.    On such grounds, I argue that while an existentialist perspective on the nature of human truth provides a valuable insight into the “doomed to be within itself” nature of living perception (i.e. the limits of accessible human truth), it is important to note that claiming *some* objective truth – if not the whole truth – is nevertheless a statement about that which reality provides – and hence *is*.

I should clarify with a distinction between *a* truth’s and *the* truth. If you have an infinite “*a”* truths (truths that are not directly representative of reality and yet anchor to *a* truth about reality that provides heuristic provision) you will own the *set* of truths that necessarily – by nature of being infinite – contain all of *the* truth (albeit with lots of excess *untruth* and indirectness). *The* truth being the entire, real, objective reality.

Such a view can be applied to the arts, and what they represent. To use music as an example, all of that which is musical (in a structural sense) is contained within the relationships between the frequencies of the notes being played. Hence, music is presenting to the subject access mathematical truths (specifically, that pertaining to ratio’s) from within the song that the subject can perceive and understand. While these relationships, and sets of relationships (relationships at a specific point in time, and the entirety of all permutations of relationships between all the notes within the given “frame” (which is seemingly *infinite*, but is in actual fact only *one* form of the many infinite's). While these truths do not directly represent the mathematical truth of reality, these truths do represent *something* of mathematical reality.

The above paragraph regarding this applied view to musical structure (i.e. musical truth) can of course be applied to visual structure (optic – as opposed to auditory – art).

,StonerPhilosophy,"Before the existence of the universe, there was nothing to give a fuck about.

But then, God said: ""Be there fucks,"" and suddenly there were fucks to give. God saw the fucks and knew they were all good...to spend. From this fundamental currency, Humanity arose.

Now, there's a debate as to whether or not humans were the first ones to give a fuck. A more heated one concerns the approximate number of fucks passed between the first human fuck and the original fuck. Some even says that God doesn't give a fuck, but im not here to force an answer upon you. - As far as this essay is concerned, my opinion is pre-biblical.

Not everyone gives a fuck about the definition of God, but amongst those that do:

Some have realized that: giving a fuck about God ingeniously gives them even more fucks to spend. This opinion has strong support from many who once ran dry on this primordial currency. This way of fuckonomics can successfully support itself, by re-investment of compund fucks;

Others realized that they can spend just as many fucks, without giving a fuck, saving a few fucks in the process.

In the lands of the internets, few seems to think you can both save your fucks and spend them at the same time.

Two fundamental question, however, remains.

\- If people give different amounts of fucks to the same thing, is it the same thing? If so:

\- Does something exist if no one gives a fuck about it? As for today, no one has ever imagined such a thing, as doing so would require an expenditure of fucks. And even if such a thing existed, no one would know, as no one would give a fuck about it.

Regardless, this idea of a fuckless world, has lead us to many of the things we today give a fuck about.

Some think this fuckery is a bit pompous, pretending to be like God, who per definition is the only creator fucks out of nothing.

Others prefer to not put God into the equation, as that could fuck with their attempts not to give a fuck.

Due to this recent trend of consciously pretending not to give a fuck in order to spend them more wisely, some of the most un-fuckwithable people have uttered their concerns. Will this lead to a depletion of fucks? Will we have to transcend to create our own fucks? You give a fuck and thusly exist, but will you exist if you truly don't give a fuck. People who manages to do this to the extent of themselves tend not to exist for long. Maybe it's worth giving a fuck afterall.

,StonerPhilosophy,"Long post, i know. In short, all Im saying is essentially what i believe life means. The last 2 paragraphs are an afterlife dream that i had just before Christmas last year.

 I reckon life is put in front of us to see if we can find the path to ""righteousness"" by learning from our mistakes and accepting other peoples mistakes by pursuing a journey to become a better person. If this path is not found by the time we die, its a nice thought for me to think that we are reborn into another experience until we find the right balance, and then the cycle is either repeated or we move to another state of reality.

 We face so many decisions every day, all of the time. We have so many memories of ourselves and other people making good and bad decisions by our own definitions. I think the meaning to life is to first of all define what we mean by good and bad, and then follow our own guidelines as best we can in order to find a fulfilling life where we accept and deal with the bad, while actively pursuing the good.

The trick that makes my theory so hard to accept is that there is no inherent purpose to life. We dont know what the end goal is or why we are even alive at all, so how to we find the ""right"" path? Maybe there is no purpose to life and it has no meaning. Maybe the right path is determined by the individual. Maybe the right path is determined by some higher being. We simply can never know, which is why Im a big believer in backing peoples beliefs, as we can never know why we are here.

I once had an afterlife dream that was relatively similar to yours. I dreamed that i fell off a building somehow and died. It felt so real. When i hit the ground, i could still feel myself with no pain, but my eyes felt voluntarily shut. I lay there in the nothingness and kind of accepted that it would be like this forever. God knows how much time passed in this state until my eyes were opened by a force other than my own. I awoke in a place that i didn't understand, where i saw ominous large unmoving figures staring into space with their eyes emitting different colours. I dont remember what else happened in that place before I was awoken as some kind of observer. I watched so many different things happen where i was completely uninvolved in it to the point where noone even noticed me, all i did was watch and hear and feel and think. A lot of places looked like paradise. It was wild.

The weirdest part of this story is that when i woke up, my girlfriend immediately told me that she dreamed that i died but couldn't remember how, only that it was very upsetting. I walked into the kitchen and my sister immediately told me that she dreamed that i died and it was so vivid that she woke up suddenly and began crying because she thought it was real.

Life is weird and trippy and confusing and stuff but the most important thing is to enjoy it. And if your not enjoying it, remember that youre never alone.

,StonerPhilosophy,"So I have a theory and a story. Bare with me.

We are in the Limbo. We are, already one foot in hell.

I  mean, look at the world, and really, really look at it, open your  eyes: Its full of horror, it's full of wrong doing, full of death and  suffering, uneven, unbalanced, corrupt.. list goes on.

Sometimes, we get a glimmer of hope, we celebrate the rightness, unless.. it's done with underling purpose to get fame, wealth or attention.  And then   it just bursts another outrage. Same loop occurs everywhere.

And   we can die from the most ridiculous causes, we can fall at home, we  can  fall at shower, we can choke to death from a piece of carrot, we  can  even, simply just die, without apparent reason, the heart just  stops. It  can happen.  
Point being, we cannot escape or even defend against death, when its time to go. Its time to go..BUT.. **How do you  know?**

At  some point in my youth I  started to state these situations, first as a joke: ""LoL, I almost  died""  when I fell at stairs, but managed to grab  the railing,

or when ground was slippery I almost fell headfirst to rocks,

or  when years back ex-GF called to break up with me, frustrated and sad, I  punched my rooms wall with my head. (yes, sounds as ridiculous as it was) As hard as I could, top first like a goat, It \[the wall\] was  painted plasterboard, so I knew it would give in and wouldn't really  hurt too much, but when done, I noticed that If I would've done it even a  little to the left, I would've hit my head straight to a large nail  sticking out.  Most likely, that would've been the end of me.

And I got the thought again, 'I almost died'.

There  are countless cases like these, and I won't list them all, I even  couldn't.   
But I do need to state one special case: I drove a serious car  accident years ago (2012 it was in local news) ( both me and the van  had \~80 km/h speed) I lost control of my car and drifted to the up  coming traffic and I collided nose to nose with a van.   
No one died, I  was only one who got injured. Major bones were broken, so I developed an Fat Embolism, so I was kept in artificial sleep in ICU (Intensive care unit) for two weeks.

If you ask  me, I was in my own/or in another world(or worlds) for months, maybe  even longer, maybe years?   
I remember the places I were in, I remember  smells, feelings, emotions and actions I did.    
I died 5 to 6 times during those dreams, and they were real. **I was there**,  I remember what my thoughts were, I remember I had different bodies,   different lives, in every single one of them, same thing, I did wrong.   
In  only one dream, the first one, I were me. I were in darkness where was one spotlight that could not be seen, white and black tile floor, there  was an cardboard prop, that was had the text  'gate to heaven', and long  story short, I was asked if I'd like to go to heaven, or hell.  
I chose heaven, but I was tricked to choose hell.

And   then the ride began. First, I went trough the wrong doing I had done, in my life, real events from third person, I saw myself talking, and I was disgusted of myself.

Then   started the Nightmerish suffering where in one of the 'lives' my limbs   were medically cut off to render me only as a torso with a head, then   hang to a wall, where I cried for help, but I were ignored. In later  ones, I helped others suffering, but were again tricked to take the  place of whoever I tried to help, ended up to suffer myself.  In those  dreams, my mother hang herself, my father got ill, and I had no one.

When I woke up, it was like any other morning to wake up, 'phewh, it was  just a bad dream'.    
Anyhow, when my dad came to see me, I was surprised  of the feeling, of being surprised, that dad was able to walk, I even asked how did he get better so quickly.   
Answer was mostly  nervous laughter.

I later started  to think about those dreams, and I found myself wondering the main  questions in this whole thing:  
**How do I know, that I didn't die?**   
How  do I know, that I'm not **still in that hospital bed?**   
Or was I, but beyond saving, and I then I did die, only to wake up in another timeline, because I still had things to do in here?

This world is as real, as those I were in.

**(TL;DR)**  
Is  every single event, where accidents happen by random, who ever is the  person that 'almost dies', in other timeline, dies. And in another \[timeline\], doesn't die, is saved, or just wakes up later with headache?

Are those moments the crossroads between timelines, and depending how you live, you are put to another, to better or worse?

  
bit messy, so please. Ask anything, I'd love to clear it up if possible.

,StonerPhilosophy,"If you look back too medieval ages, they had monarchies, trade/barter systems, sword and arrow warfare, and less technologies. Life was simpler than it is now (at least according to history). However, I would argue that life was in itself harsh. Because humans did not have advanced technologies and political structures as today, they do not have to deal with cyber warfare, social security numbers, and even online magazine subscriptions . They don't have those extra stressors. 

However, it remains balanced because they have stressors such as having to pay their king taxes, working for said king, living in poorer conditions, and shitting in the street from their balcony. The royals, soldiers, scribes?, and other societally ""higher"" people lived a different lifestyle than peasants, but also had their own balance. They had to fight wars, manage kingdoms, protect their people, but they also lived a good life. They were rich, lived in decent house (for the time), and had their say over people in society.

Nowadays,  we still have the same balance between the pros and cons of each ""class"" in society, yet our life is much more complex (at least in first world countries, but even third world countries are more complex than the medieval ages...duh). We have entire systems set up within a small town (lets say 500 acres) to allow for that town to operate (sewage, electricity, internet, mail, groceries, banks, etc.). That is SO much more complex than it used to be. But with more complexity, comes more opportunity for balance! 

Have a great sewage system that works fantastic? Well guess what, life is gonna balance it out. Now you have poop all over your house because your pipe burst in your bathroom.

Have a fantastic medical system that can fix almost anything? Yeah. we're gonna make it super fucking expensive. If we can't make it expensive, we'll just make it super long waits, super long distances away, or shitty doctors.

Again, life has it's balances :)

So then, let's ask this question:

If life becomes more complex as time passes (to the individual), then could we assume that the opportunity for balancing increases over time?

If we can assume that, then is life like an AI computer program that produces this experiences for us?Does it operate like this so we can go and learn, create, and advance, thus providing the operating system with more balance, creating a neutral world? 

That neutral world is created over time, and as time progresses, then the balance increases, thus making the neutral world a truly balanced system where it can predict most anomalies and create balance between them from the data it has learned over time?

Okay, now I think it's time for me to stop theorizing and go take a fucking shower.",t2_11yj1i,False,,0,False,"As the advancement of society continues and we develop our technology, political structures, societal structures, and so forth, life will become more complex but still remain balanced between the pros and cons of living during said time period.",[],r/StonerPhilosophy,False,,,0,False,t3_fao3h2,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1582888133.0,text,,,,text,self.StonerPhilosophy,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look back too medieval ages, they had monarchies, trade/barter systems, sword and arrow warfare, and less technologies. Life was simpler than it is now (at least according to history). However, I would argue that life was in itself harsh. Because humans did not have advanced technologies and political structures as today, they do not have to deal with cyber warfare, social security numbers, and even online magazine subscriptions . They don&amp;#39;t have those extra stressors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it remains balanced because they have stressors such as having to pay their king taxes, working for said king, living in poorer conditions, and shitting in the street from their balcony. The royals, soldiers, scribes?, and other societally &amp;quot;higher&amp;quot; people lived a different lifestyle than peasants, but also had their own balance. They had to fight wars, manage kingdoms, protect their people, but they also lived a good life.

&lt;p&gt;Again, life has it&amp;#39;s balances :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then, let&amp;#39;s ask this question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If life becomes more complex as time passes (to the individual), then could we assume that the opportunity for balancing increases over time?&lt;/p&gt;

,StonerPhilosophy,"I have heard many things throughout my ten thousand or so years of existing; and one of the more audacious beliefs I’ve come across is that you cannot assign objective values to subjective concepts. To this, dear reader, I say “balderdash”. You absolutely *can* assign objective values to anything you please, and I’m going to prove it to you right now by showing you exactly why yellow is the best colour and anyone who says otherwise is wrong. Tally-ho!

Yellow nature: you gain the colour yellow by mixing the colours orange and green in the light spectrum, or red and green for electronic purposes. Clearly you can already see its perfection, for red and orange are both power colours, drawing the eye, and red and green are complementary colours, suiting eachother perfectly; as they should, considering they make the best colour combined. Most other colours are murky, drab, or even overused; but yellow is an untapped market, excelling in the form of simplicity and quality over quantity. It has a pop and vibrance that no other colour can match, whilst not being glaring and tacky like perfect (yeah, perfectly scuffable) white. It is the brightest, most sensational, most vibrant colour on the spectrum that radiates outward. It goes well with any colour, and neither takes the spotlight nor stays in the background; this is especially true when paired with more royal colours like purple. Fitting, is it not? That the greatest of colours stands beside royalty.

Uses of note: The Lascaux cave in France has an ancient painting of a horse using, dominantly, yellow, and is over 17,000 thousand years old! Thus making it one of the oldest colours to ever be used in painting. Yellow has also seen extreme use in the works of gold and skin dyes in ancient Egyptian tombs, all the way up to Roman murals. Surely, if Pharaohs and Emperors can see the merit of such a glorious colour, so too can you. In fact, yellow is so important that it was even used in the artistic portrayal of Byzantine Emperor Justinian (who was, fittingly, one of the greatest of Emperors), and was also incorporated into the flag of the Paleologus Dynasty; along with red. In fact, it has even more merit if you are of religious temperament, for early in its history, yellow was associated with the pope and the keys to heaven! Alongside Judus Iscariot and heretics of note. And if you are of royal standing, you too shall appreciate yellow, for in China of old it was reserved only for the Emperor and his family, and honoured guests were welcomed with a glorious yellow carpet. In fact, it was considered so right for a child, conceived of heaven, to be draped with yellow that the last emperor of China, Puyi, described how it felt to be surrounded by it: ""It made me understand from my most tender age that I was of a unique essence, and it instilled in me the consciousness of my 'celestial nature' which made me different from every other human”.

Associations: In recent surveys worldwide, it was found that people often see yellow as a sign of happiness, amusement, gentleness, spontaneity, wisdom, connectivity, glory, and harmony. But don’t let this peaceful talk fool you! Yellow is also associated with avarice, cowardice, and sickness; so even immoral folks can find something to enjoy.

Etymology: Yellow, as you would have guessed, is a very old word, with proto-Germanic roots, and shares the same base (in this case: Ghel) as the words Gold and Yell; using this, we can see that yellow is simply “Brightness and gleam that cries out to you”. It comes naturally to such beauty.

In the world of science: Lasers that emit yellow light are among the most rare and expensive, naturally, and are more frequently used in the field of Optogenetics: the control of living cells through light and colour signals; again, fitting that a colour devoted to Emperors has express use in the control of the very cells and neurons that line our brains. In the field of Astronomy, stars of Spectral Class F have a yellow hue, much less aggressive and menacing than the better known white and red dwarfs. In Biology, yellow is a key player in chloroplasts and chromoplasts. If you don’t know what those are, that’s okay, all you need to know is that they allow for algae (and most other plants) to photosynthesize, as well as protect themselves from photo-damage. This is significant, since 75% of the oxygen for our entire wonderful planet come from algae (with the other 25% coming from rainforests and other sources); ergo, in a very real way, the colour yellow allows us all to breathe, which is something we need to do to live or something (But there are even more important benefits to oxygen than that! Including things such as volume/height, bone density, energy, protection from UV rays, and other such nonsense; thus, if you really really enjoy sports, particularly basketball, thank yellow today).

In the world of art: Few people know this, but yellow was one of the first colours used in art due to its widely available pigment; found in only the best of things. Truly, it could easily be said that without yellow, art would have been set back by hundreds, if not thousands of years! As China was held back by its love of ceramics, and so never developing glass on its own, so too would the greatest artists of all time had been held back, should yellow not have been about. What would the artistic world be like without the likes of Vincent Van Gogh, who used yellow and purple extensively? Where would mathematics be without addition? Where would geometry be without squares? So too, I ask you, where would art be without yellow? Exactly.

In the world of history: We have already spoken of yellow’s connection to ancient works of art; what with being important enough to lavish over Emperors and great murals, but what of pre-classical history? After being established as the colour of heretics and traitors (an **unjust** assertion I tell you, for it only became associated as such through being related to Judus Iscariot, *despite the fact* there was never any mention of the colours he bore. Such baseless rumors were surely tossed about by the foul naysayers of yellow. Likely fans of brown. Ew.) it was common to see those under persecution from the Spanish Inquisition brought forward wearing yellow capes, where they would make a case as to why they refused to renounce their faith. You see, even in its darkest moments, yellow has deep associations of resistance and fortitude in the face of misfortune and prejudice (Hold your banners high, rebels!). Over time, the symbol of yellow changed from heretics to financiers and lenders, those who allowed people the economic freedom to pursue their dreams and fund their endeavours. In more modern times, Jean-Honoré Fragonard made his greatest painting: “The Reader” primarily using yellows. The painter J.W.M Turner, in his painting “Rain, Steam, and Speed” (dominantly yellow as well), popularized the theme of using colour to convey emotion. And, of course, Vincent Van Gogh himself was a great admirer of the colour yellow, writing to his sister: ""Now we are having beautiful warm, windless weather that is very beneficial to me. The sun, a light that for lack of a better word I can only call yellow, bright sulfur yellow, pale lemon gold. How beautiful yellow is!"". Oh dear Mr.Gogh, I cannot help but agree. In the 20th century, yellow was used and esteemed extensively for its visibility and shine; since it could be seen from far away, it was frequently used in all sorts of advertisements, safety information/signs, and even emergency vehicles, as it should, for everyone ought to be comforted by seeing such brilliance.

Symbolism: Yellow as paint commonly symbolizes warmth and energy, especially when paired with red; it also feels softer and more natural than glaring white, hence the popularity of yellow lights. Yellow is also often associated with intellect and wisdom, as the words commonly used to describe it: “Brilliant” and “Bright”, also mean someone of grand intellect. In Islam, yellow symbolizes wisdom, and it was similar in medieval Europe, where it represented reason. This association has extended far into the modern day, where in many European universities, faculty involved in research and the sciences wear yellow gowns. In ancient Greece and Rome, the gods were portrayed with yellow hair, and the Maya glyph for yellow also translates to “Precious”.

Yellow has seen a great amount of representation, not only in history, art, and safety, but even politics, music, metaphysics, sports, transportation, and even maritime signaling. For its bright colour, popping contrast, and high visibility, it has easily been one of the most useful and well loved colours among the more dangerous professions, and is easily the most reliable colour in precarious situations.

It can be seen, clear as the colour itself, that yellow easily outclasses every other colour in both practicability, divine symbolism, versatility, and, most importantly, my esteem. It is by no slim margin that I declare yellow is the greatest of all colours; and while, of course, it is okay for others to disagree and have their own favourites besides, they must live with themselves being wrong for the rest of their life. No such fate for you, I’m sure.

Truth be told, this is less of an essay on the perfection of the colour yellow, and more-so an essay to demonstrate one’s ability to assign objective value to subjective concepts. It is absolutely possible to do so, as you’ve just seen, and must be possible, for everything in our world operates on subjective bounds. Whether it is arithmetic, chemicals, or even practical objects such as desks, pencils, and glass. Squares, triangles, circles, the most basic forms in our world all have subjective value, for their value is dependent upon their relationship with other things. Is 10 a lot? Well that depends on whether you’re talking about smarties or people trying to stab you. Would you build a stationary object with circles? Of course not, worthless. Squares are much preferred; but you would build a moving object with one, wherein squares would become the lesser.

Nothing is better or worse than anything else if it's in a vacuum, measured only against itself and its own merit; just as if you fought your clone, no true victor would ever emerge; but that doesn't mean you're Bruce Lee or a drunk hobo. Value is contextual, and varies from situation to situation, including with otherwise subjective or abstract concepts.

Value is measured, not by the concreteness of the subject you’re dealing with, but in its relationship with its surrounding environment, rivals, and cooperators. A gun is better to have in a fight than a pencil, but a gun can’t help you write a novel. The end goal you are aiming toward is key in assigning these values, and how you choose to reach that goal depends upon you. Hencefourth, never allow anyone to tell you that the subjectivity of a topic precludes it from criticism, judgement, or accurate measurement; only tell them that the weight of its worth depends upon what it is being measured against, as your soul against a feather when facing Osiris.  In this vein, we can clearly see the value of yellow when measured against all comers and all subjects, thus truly making it the best of the best; and the longer you disagree with my assessment, the heavier your soul is going to be with the weight of your guilt.

&lt;p&gt;In the world of science: Lasers that emit yellow light are among the most rare and expensive, naturally, and are more frequently used in the field of Optogenetics: the control of living cells through light and colour signals; again, fitting that a colour devoted to Emperors has express use in the control of the very cells and neurons that line our brains. In the field of Astronomy, stars of Spectral Class F have a yellow hue, much less aggressive and menacing than the better known white and red dwarfs. In Biology, yellow is a key player in chloroplasts and chromoplasts. If you don’t know what those are, that’s okay, all you need to know is that they allow for algae (and most other plants) to photosynthesize, as well as protect themselves from photo-damage. This is significant, since 75% of the oxygen for our entire wonderful planet come from algae (with the other 25% coming from rainforests and other sources); ergo, in a very real way, the colour yellow allows us all to breathe, which is something we need to do to live or something (But there are even more important benefits to oxygen than that! Including things such as volume/height, bone density, energy, protection from UV rays, and other such nonsense; thus, if you really really enjoy sports, particularly basketball, thank yellow today).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of art: Few people know this, but yellow was one of the first colours used in art due to its widely available pigment; found in only the best of things. Truly, it could easily be said that without yellow, art would have been set back by hundreds, if not thousands of years! As China was held back by its love of ceramics, and so never developing glass on its own, so too would the greatest artists of all time had been held back, should yellow not have been about. What would the artistic world be like without the likes of Vincent Van Gogh, who used yellow and purple extensively? Where would mathematics be without addition? Where would geometry be without squares? So too, I ask you, where would art be without yellow? Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of history: We have already spoken of yellow’s connection to ancient works of art; what with being important enough to lavish over Emperors and great murals, but what of pre-classical history? After being established as the colour of heretics and traitors (an &lt;strong&gt;unjust&lt;/strong&gt; assertion I tell you, for it only became associated as such through being related to Judus Iscariot, &lt;em&gt;despite the fact&lt;/em&gt; there was never any mention of the colours he bore. Such baseless rumors were surely tossed about by the foul naysayers of yellow. Likely fans of brown. Ew.) it was common to see those under persecution from the Spanish Inquisition brought forward wearing yellow capes, where they would make a case as to why they refused to renounce their faith. You see, even in its darkest moments, yellow has deep associations of resistance and fortitude in the face of misfortune and prejudice (Hold your banners high, rebels!). Over time, the symbol of yellow changed from heretics to financiers and lenders, those who allowed people the economic freedom to pursue their dreams and fund their endeavours. In more modern times, Jean-Honoré Fragonard made his greatest painting: “The Reader” primarily using yellows. The painter J.W.M Turner, in his painting “Rain, Steam, and Speed” (dominantly yellow as well), popularized the theme of using colour to convey emotion. And, of course, Vincent Van Gogh himself was a great admirer of the colour yellow, writing to his sister: &amp;quot;Now we are having beautiful warm, windless weather that is very beneficial to me. The sun, a light that for lack of a better word I can only call yellow, bright sulfur yellow, pale lemon gold. How beautiful yellow is!&amp;quot;. Oh dear Mr.Gogh, I cannot help but agree. In the 20th century, yellow was used and esteemed extensively for its visibility and shine; since it could be seen from far away, it was frequently used in all sorts of advertisements, safety information/signs, and even emergency vehicles, as it should, for everyone ought to be comforted by seeing such brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symbolism: Yellow as paint commonly symbolizes warmth and energy, especially when paired with red; it also feels softer and more natural than glaring white, hence the popularity of yellow lights. Yellow is also often associated with intellect and wisdom, as the words commonly used to describe it: “Brilliant” and “Bright”, also mean someone of grand intellect. In Islam, yellow symbolizes wisdom, and it was similar in medieval Europe, where it represented reason. This association has extended far into the modern day, where in many European universities, faculty involved in research and the sciences wear yellow gowns. In ancient Greece and Rome, the gods were portrayed with yellow hair, and the Maya glyph for yellow also translates to “Precious”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow has seen a great amount of representation, not only in history, art, and safety, but even politics, music, metaphysics, sports, transportation, and even maritime signaling. For its bright colour, popping contrast, and high visibility, it has easily been one of the most useful and well loved colours among the more dangerous professions, and is easily the most reliable colour in precarious situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be seen, clear as the colour itself, that yellow easily outclasses every other colour in both practicability, divine symbolism, versatility, and, most importantly, my esteem. It is by no slim margin that I declare yellow is the greatest of all colours; and while, of course, it is okay for others to disagree and have their own favourites besides, they must live with themselves being wrong for the rest of their life. No such fate for you, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, this is less of an essay on the perfection of the colour yellow, and more-so an essay to demonstrate one’s ability to assign objective value to subjective concepts. It is absolutely possible to do so, as you’ve just seen, and must be possible, for everything in our world operates on subjective bounds. Whether it is arithmetic, chemicals, or even practical objects such as desks, pencils, and glass. Squares, triangles, circles, the most basic forms in our world all have subjective value, for their value is dependent upon their relationship with other things. Is 10 a lot? Well that depends on whether you’re talking about smarties or people trying to stab you. Would you build a stationary object with circles? Of course not, worthless. Squares are much preferred; but you would build a moving object with one, wherein squares would become the lesser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is better or worse than anything else if it&amp;#39;s in a vacuum, measured only against itself and its own merit; just as if you fought your clone, no true victor would ever emerge; but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re Bruce Lee or a drunk hobo. Value is contextual, and varies from situation to situation, including with otherwise subjective or abstract concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value is measured, not by the concreteness of the subject you’re dealing with, but in its relationship with its surrounding environment, rivals, and cooperators. A gun is better to have in a fight than a pencil, but a gun can’t help you write a novel. The end goal you are aiming toward is key in assigning these values, and how you choose to reach that goal depends upon you. Hencefourth, never allow anyone to tell you that the subjectivity of a topic precludes it from criticism, judgement, or accurate measurement; only tell them that the weight of its worth depends upon what it is being measured against, as your soul against a feather when facing Osiris.  In this vein, we can clearly see the value of yellow when measured against all comers and all subjects, thus truly making it the best of the best; and the longer you disagree with my assessment, the heavier your soul is going to be with the weight of your guilt. Prepare yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

Learning to play multiple games (or songs) can be tough as well as switching genres of video games (or music). Only difference is music is structured to produce a certain sound whereas video games let you have all the control to make their own “interactive music”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents will dish out $1000s of dollars to get their kid piano lessons but also nag at them for playing a video game. WHY!? Especially with esports taking off it should be encouraged. It helps with hand eye coordination and quick decision making while also being fun as fuck and social with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

,StonerPhilosophy,"This is what I've been able to come up with: 

   If you were shown one face of a 3D cube and could only see one face of it, how would you know if it was a 3D cube? You would have to turn it to see another side of it or to move to get another angle where you could see another side of the cube . The action of turning the cube or moving to another angle requires time to preform. So with that logic, if time was paused, you would only be seeing 2D shapes, there would be no way to determine if the side of the cube you saw was part of a cube or a square since there would be no change in time and an action could not be preformed. The pause of time is basically our definition for a ""moment"", this would mean that in every moment, you can only see 2D.

   If the 4th dimension is a level above the 3rd dimension, that would mean in every moment of the 4th dimension, you would be able to see 3D. This means that if you were to show only one side of a cube to a person from the 4th dimension and pause time, they would still be able to see that the side of the cube belongs to a 3D cube. Living in the 4th dimension would be live living in a moment of the 3rd dimension, having time within the time of the 3rd dimension.

Then as the minutes tick by bad news just seems to find you over and over until the world is still, and you can start to examine if it was really that bad or if you just got caught up in a wave. 

I debated whether to post this because I wasn’t sure how it would be received but I’ve always been an optimist disguised as a cynic who’s actually more of a realist. I just happen to experience reality quite differently than most of the people I know. I’m not special, I just have a weird life and I sadly seem to be in the minority on this topic. 

It’s been a frustrating week with only small moments of levity, mostly with a friend of mine. She is a pretty remarkable person. We spoke about great movies so when it came time to finally relax after everyone else was asleep I got to being introspective while trying to figure out what to watch which led to me selecting one of my all time favourite “life” movies featuring old dudes that went through it all; The Bucket List. 

There’s an interpretation of ancient Egyptian religion that says when their people died and went up to heaven they were asked only 2 questions, which when answered with honest yeses, entry would be granted. 

Have you found joy in your life, and has your life brought joy to others?

The first time I heard those questions was when I watched the Bucket List originally. The questions really stuck with me so I read more stories surrounding the quote and treatment of death by the Egyptians. 

To further interpret the first question you must have experienced a moment or person, or both so profoundly that you thought you could die right there and all the pain of living would have been worth it just for that single fleeting blip in time.

The second question more directly is almost impossible to answer until it’s not. Interpreted, I think it really means you live your life in such a way that you’re confident you’ve seen that previous question answered in someone else’s mind’s eye. You can’t be sure but you just know instinctually that you had a moment with someone that was unexplainable and as damn near perfect as it gets. 

I think this is the truest story of morality ever told. It’s not lousy with sins that don’t make sense forcing you to do things in service of faith. Neither can be used as a tool or a weapon by those with no morality like many religious texts. This is as pure a lesson as any.

But, you have to think that since Heaven is the ultimate personification and symbol of good then we can all understand the importance of being able to be a part of the ultimate good (even if it’s just twice) through these simple and seemingly easy acts. In reality, too many people live without this self-actualization. 

I know more people that wouldn’t be able to say yes to these questions honestly than I do those that would walk through the pearly gates. 

That, right there, is the sad state of our existence. As we continue to shrink our world we as well shrink what accomplishment means. Many moons ago the ultimate accomplishment was bringing home the hunt with your bare hands for your family. Not too long ago it was winning a game. Now, it’s getting the most likes. 

We have done the same thing with happiness. I’m sure way back when a man was happiest when he met the woman of his dreams, or when he woke up one day and realized he had. Now, in 2020 we’re only happy if we get a couple of matches every day. A lot of people don’t even answer others on Tinder. They just feel happy knowing that someone out there thinks they’re attractive enough. 

As a man that can answer both of those life defining questions with a yes I can tell you there is only one take away worth mentioning from each time I felt that kind of joy. 

I could have died in those moments having experienced them for just a fraction of a second. More importantly, all the years of life treating me like a basketball would have been the actual blips. Real, hardcore joy is something I can return to whenever I want for as long as I want. Perhaps I will live in them for all of eternity. They will always save me from any storm that comes.  

So why do I write this? I don’t actually believe all that many people will read to the end. I just write it because it really dawned on me that with all the depressing statuses I’ve seen lately and mental health talk that perhaps someone needs to see this and understand what the gaping hole is they feel in their chest. I know a lot of people that are depressed and yes I think drug addiction, bad luck and hormone imbalances cause a lot of issues but I also think trying to live a certain way or be a certain type of person against a nagging nature is also a fundamental issue. This world isn’t designed for genuine expression, but rather it’s starting to feel like one colossal reality show. 

Please, if you can say no to either of those questions  then change what you’re doing.  Quit your job, leave your loveless relationship, flirt with that crush, jump out of that plane, go full throttle on whatever it is you instinctively know will make you happy and never apologize for doing any of it. 

I’m telling you, anything you thought was important before—including and especially money—will seem insignificant every time you think about those moments. 

Get the key to the gates by being happy. At least, I really hope that’s how this all works because I haven’t put money in a collection plate for a really long time.

&lt;p&gt;There’s an interpretation of ancient Egyptian religion that says when their people died and went up to heaven they were asked only 2 questions, which when answered with honest yeses, entry would be granted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you found joy in your life, and has your life brought joy to others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard those questions was when I watched the Bucket List originally. The questions really stuck with me so I read more stories surrounding the quote and treatment of death by the Egyptians. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further interpret the first question you must have experienced a moment or person, or both so profoundly that you thought you could die right there and all the pain of living would have been worth it just for that single fleeting blip in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second question more directly is almost impossible to answer until it’s not. Interpreted, I think it really means you live your life in such a way that you’re confident you’ve seen that previous question answered in someone else’s mind’s eye. You can’t be sure but you just know instinctually that you had a moment with someone that was unexplainable and as damn near perfect as it gets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is the truest story of morality ever told. It’s not lousy with sins that don’t make sense forcing you to do things in service of faith. Neither can be used as a tool or a weapon by those with no morality like many religious texts. This is as pure a lesson as any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, you have to think that since Heaven is the ultimate personification and symbol of good then we can all understand the importance of being able to be a part of the ultimate good (even if it’s just twice) through these simple and seemingly easy acts. In reality, too many people live without this self-actualization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know more people that wouldn’t be able to say yes to these questions honestly than I do those that would walk through the pearly gates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, right there, is the sad state of our existence. As we continue to shrink our world we as well shrink what accomplishment means. Many moons ago the ultimate accomplishment was bringing home the hunt with your bare hands for your family. Not too long ago it was winning a game. Now, it’s getting the most likes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have done the same thing with happiness. I’m sure way back when a man was happiest when he met the woman of his dreams, or when he woke up one day and realized he had. Now, in 2020 we’re only happy if we get a couple of matches every day. A lot of people don’t even answer others on Tinder. They just feel happy knowing that someone out there thinks they’re attractive enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a man that can answer both of those life defining questions with a yes I can tell you there is only one take away worth mentioning from each time I felt that kind of joy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have died in those moments having experienced them for just a fraction of a second. More importantly, all the years of life treating me like a basketball would have been the actual blips. Real, hardcore joy is something I can return to whenever I want for as long as I want. Perhaps I will live in them for all of eternity. They will always save me from any storm that comes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do I write this? I don’t actually believe all that many people will read to the end. I just write it because it really dawned on me that with all the depressing statuses I’ve seen lately and mental health talk that perhaps someone needs to see this and understand what the gaping hole is they feel in their chest. I know a lot of people that are depressed and yes I think drug addiction, bad luck and hormone imbalances cause a lot of issues but I also think trying to live a certain way or be a certain type of person against a nagging nature is also a fundamental issue. This world isn’t designed for genuine expression, but rather it’s starting to feel like one colossal reality show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, if you can say no to either of those questions  then change what you’re doing.  Quit your job, leave your loveless relationship, flirt with that crush, jump out of that plane, go full throttle on whatever it is you instinctively know will make you happy and never apologize for doing any of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m telling you, anything you thought was important before—including and especially money—will seem insignificant every time you think about those moments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the key to the gates by being happy. At least, I really hope that’s how this all works because I haven’t put money in a collection plate for a really long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all I have to say. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.&lt;/p&gt;

,StonerPhilosophy,"I feel like most people are unconsciously confident of the fact that they are who they think they are. Like they've lived their whole lives getting comfortable with their personality and are confident in who they are but never really realize that no matter what, people change over time. You just cant avoid it. The fact is who are are right now will never be exactly the same as the person you are 10 or even 20 years down the line. You're certainly not the same as you were 10 years ago either. Life happens, you may go through a traumatic experience, develope a brain disease, or learn something new that alters the course of your life and now you're in a situation where 10 years ago you were ""that funny guy"" and could have gone on to be a successful comedian but instead you went into the military and witnessed war and now you're not the same guy and have PTSD and is a shut in. This is why it's almost impossible for you to plan out your future career when you're in highschool. I wanted to draw comic books for a living but have lost interest and now I'm thinking of being a PI. People talk about how they want world piece but then grow up and start to question what that even means, ""world piece? So everyone is ok with everyone's differences and no one questions anything? That sounds terrifying."" A quote from Louis C.K. kinda relates to what I'm saying
""When you wake up every day, nothing has changed. But when you look back at the past, nothing is the same."" -Louie

I've never been afraid of change intfact I've always welcomed it and from the time I was 4 I've thought about how different I'm gonna be when I'm 40. Literally anything could happened and that's what's always set me apart from my friends or family. I've always had intense and complex philosophical ideas racing around in my mind and I've never found anyone I could share them with. It's one of the reasons I've always been terrible at school cause what's the point? School is the government preparing you for college so you can be a productive member of society but college is a huge financial scam and more than half the stuff I've learned in school I'll never use in real life. But since no one I try to explain this to understands they just try to put me on medication and punish me for not complying. I'm so fucking self-aware about everything it confuses me the general things people do in society that everyone has gotten used to like wearing loose pieces of fabric around your neck to signify professionalism and not putting your elbows on the table while eating to show respect. Why? Idk bro I guess I'm just gonna go unnoticed by the world and die at 70 in my crappy, cheap apartment knowing life is pointless. I just wish I was blissfully ignorant about life so I could sit down and enjoy it for once.

Btw this isn't a cry for help or anything I'm not suicidal just want to get some of my thoughts out there to feed my ego.",t2_51hno9rz,False,,0,False,People change,[],r/StonerPhilosophy,False,,,0,False,t3_f74u1m,False,dark,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1582283355.0,text,,,,text,self.StonerPhilosophy,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like most people are unconsciously confident of the fact that they are who they think they are. Like they&amp;#39;ve lived their whole lives getting comfortable with their personality and are confident in who they are but never really realize that no matter what, people change over time. You just cant avoid it. The fact is who are are right now will never be exactly the same as the person you are 10 or even 20 years down the line. You&amp;#39;re certainly not the same as you were 10 years ago either. Life happens, you may go through a traumatic experience, develope a brain disease, or learn something new that alters the course of your life and now you&amp;#39;re in a situation where 10 years ago you were &amp;quot;that funny guy&amp;quot; and could have gone on to be a successful comedian but instead you went into the military and witnessed war and now you&amp;#39;re not the same guy and have PTSD and is a shut in. This is why it&amp;#39;s almost impossible for you to plan out your future career when you&amp;#39;re in highschool. I wanted to draw comic books for a living but have lost interest and now I&amp;#39;m thinking of being a PI. People talk about how they want world piece but then grow up and start to question what that even means, &amp;quot;world piece? So everyone is ok with everyone&amp;#39;s differences and no one questions anything? That sounds terrifying.&amp;quot; A quote from Louis C.K. kinda relates to what I&amp;#39;m saying
&amp;quot;When you wake up every day, nothing has changed. But when you look back at the past, nothing is the same.&amp;quot; -Louie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never been afraid of change intfact I&amp;#39;ve always welcomed it and from the time I was 4 I&amp;#39;ve thought about how different I&amp;#39;m gonna be when I&amp;#39;m 40. Literally anything could happened and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s always set me apart from my friends or family. I&amp;#39;ve always had intense and complex philosophical ideas racing around in my mind and I&amp;#39;ve never found anyone I could share them with. It&amp;#39;s one of the reasons I&amp;#39;ve always been terrible at school cause what&amp;#39;s the point? School is the government preparing you for college so you can be a productive member of society but college is a huge financial scam and more than half the stuff I&amp;#39;ve learned in school I&amp;#39;ll never use in real life. But since no one I try to explain this to understands they just try to put me on medication and punish me for not complying.
