,boardgames,"Hi everyone! 

I love the idea of Disney's Villainous, though I must admit, I've never actually gotten it to the table. I had an idea this morning, though, for a character from one of my favorite movies: AUTO, the ship's autopilot from Wall-E. 

(Apologies if I don't have the terms right: as I said, I've never played the game)

My ideas:

* AUTO starts with the heroes Wall-E and Eve in play, along with an item called ""Plant.""
* AUTO's goal is to take an ""Attack"" action at a location where the Plant is when there are no Heroes in play. 
* Many of AUTO's Allies are shipboard robots, including BRL-A (the umbrella bot), PR-T (the beautician bot), and so on. Each of these provide a passive bonus to other robots at their location: BRL-A might need to be defeated first, PR-T might enhance their strength, for example.
* Many of AUTO's Fate cards allow a Hero to ""liberate"" an Ally robot at their location, turning them into Heroes. These robots then provide their passive bonuses to the Heroes at their location.
* AUTO can capture robots, both Allies and Heroes, using a ""Red Boot"" card, turning them into Allies.
* AUTO also has access to GO-4 (his crony) and a number of Stewards (the security bots), who cannot be ""liberated."" 
* GO-4 may not be able to help (much) in combat, but has the ability to move the Plant.

&amp;#x200B;

The goal here would be to create something like a constantly-shifting civil war: AUTO needs to clear the board of Heroes, but the Heroes are constantly stealing his Allies and other resources. However, I feel like this could be fairly cheese-able, if, for example, other players don't engage with AUTOs Fate deck enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, I have not yet played Villainous, so I don't know if this is even workable.

So, the basics. Started collecting shortly after I got together with my now wife about 8 years ago. She prefers the simpler, shorter games (Bees: the Secret Kingdom, Flux, etc) where I lean more into the complex, long and grandiose (Kingdom Death, Twilight Imperium). We only have 1-2 games we haven't played and that is because they are new, those being MindClash Cerebria and Everdell but we have plans to play those in the coming week, so I can't really answer anything about those as of yet. 

But seriously the only thing stopping this list from being twice as long is that I only have so much space. I have a giant wishlist and am only waiting to clear space in our basement/play area thing to start buying. 

As far as changing things about my collection, it isn't ""a what would I"" it's a ""what do I"". We get a decent amount of games that either don't have enough depth to want to keep or don't pan out to what they thought we were so we regularly get rid of them. Usually donating to a local library or giving to friends/neighbors. Currently planning to Axe Munchkin Quest and Miskatonic but everything else visible is safe. 

Favorite game? By far Tsuro Classic. Top 3? Tsuro, Kingdom Death, Bees: The Secret Kingdom. I'll include a list of everything here below since some of it might be hard to read, and the current wishlist below that if you want to throw an opinion about some of them.

Thanks for reading!

&lt;p&gt;But seriously the only thing stopping this list from being twice as long is that I only have so much space. I have a giant wishlist and am only waiting to clear space in our basement/play area thing to start buying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as changing things about my collection, it isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;a what would I&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;what do I&amp;quot;. We get a decent amount of games that either don&amp;#39;t have enough depth to want to keep or don&amp;#39;t pan out to what they thought we were so we regularly get rid of them. Usually donating to a local library or giving to friends/neighbors. Currently planning to Axe Munchkin Quest and Miskatonic but everything else visible is safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite game? By far Tsuro Classic. Top 3? Tsuro, Kingdom Death, Bees: The Secret Kingdom. I&amp;#39;ll include a list of everything here below since some of it might be hard to read, and the current wishlist below that if you want to throw an opinion about some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

,boardgames,"**Welcome to /r/boardgames Daily Discussion and Game Recommendations**

This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post. You can see previous versions of this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/search?q=%22%2Fr%2Fboardgames+Daily+Discussion+and+Game+Recommendations%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). 

If you are seeking game recommendations you will get better responses if you give us enough background to help you. You can use [this template](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer) to do so. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template) is a version with explanations of what we're looking for.  

Help people identify your game suggestions easily by bolding the game names. It's easy! Just surround the game name with two asterisks (\*\*) and it will show up bold. If you reply to any comment that has a game name in **bold** with ""**/u/r2d8 getparentinfo**"", one of our robots will tell you more about the game

,boardgames,"I got Mottainai because GTR was out of print. Mottainai was fresh and interesting but didn't really get to the table enough. There was something that stopped it from becoming a hit in my household. Then I managed to get the GTR black box pnped. 

Having played **Glory to Rome** a few times, I see why this game has such a frenzied following. Also I have these conclusions on GTR vis-a-vis Mottainai:

1. GTR is a far superior game to Mottainai
2. GTR is much more easier to teach and learn than Mottainai
3. GTR is way more fun than Mottainai

Mottainai just doesn't replace GTR. It's a good game but just a poor substitute for GTR. If you haven't played GTR but are interested by Mottainai or those multi use cards games, I think you can still get your own PnP of the black box edition based on the files in BGG. Go for it. It's totally worth it.

**Update**: Some reasons why I say the above (copied from my comments below). 

The rulebook of GTR is one of the best I've seen. Narrates the flow of the game well, explains with good examples and whole section detailing each card and its usage (at least in the one in this black box edition).

In mottainai, the way the tasks are explained is a bit confusing and makes it more complex than it is. 

GTR feels more thematic than Mottainai. You are rebuilding Rome. You need materials. Patrons will being 'clients' such as Labourers to your clientele. Labourers will bring materials to a stockpile. Architects will use the material in the stockpile to build the building on the card. Craftsman don't depend on the stockpile to build. Merchants help you siphon some of the stockpile for your personal profit in your vault. 

Both the size of the clientele and the vault will depend on your influence which you get from buildings you build. Once built the buildings give you special abilities. The story and theme runs so smooth here. Almost all cards and their abilities are easy to remember as the card title and the content has a thematic connection.

Mottainai also has a theme but it doesn't flow naturally. Acolyte in a monastery doesn't quite fit with the actions in the game, in my view.

I find the card abilities in GTR is easier to understand and follow and most importantly to remember than that of Mottainai. Perhaps I can show some examples from mottainai later.

GTR can also be mean which is perfect for a 'wonky' game where every one of the 100+ cards are meant to break the rules of the game. Mottainai has some cards that can hurt others but GTR had a legionary action over and above the mean cards. This is a big contributor to the fun element of the game. Some may not like this but this is a game that's light in theme and ideas so some take that is going to be fun.

Will share more thoughts later...",t2_14cw5j,False,,0,False,Glory to Rome vs Mottainai,[],r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gg7p7v,False,dark,0.52,,public,1,0,{},,dea07cbc-18aa-11e7-be9d-0ed152d2be1c,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,self,1589009134.0,hansa-teutonica,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '... but it is the goal that is important, not the winning...

Mottainai was fresh and interesting but didn&amp;#39;t really get to the table enough. There was something that stopped it from becoming a hit in my household. Then I managed to get the GTR black box pnped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having played &lt;strong&gt;Glory to Rome&lt;/strong&gt; a few times, I see why this game has such a frenzied following. Also I have these conclusions on GTR vis-a-vis Mottainai:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GTR is a far superior game to Mottainai&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GTR is much more easier to teach and learn than Mottainai&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GTR is way more fun than Mottainai&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mottainai just doesn&amp;#39;t replace GTR. It&amp;#39;s a good game but just a poor substitute for GTR. If you haven&amp;#39;t played GTR but are interested by Mottainai or those multi use cards games, I think you can still get your own PnP of the black box edition based on the files in BGG. Go for it. It&amp;#39;s totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

As any game, ""King Taco"" has a goal. The goal, what you want to do is win, by having the Marshmallow Hat in your hand. Also, you want to do this while following the rules too. If a player gives a Super Flavor to King Taco, and looks at the current King's Preference, and it matches, the player may put the Marshmallow Hat in their hand.

##           Terminology

Capitalization of words matters! 'Draw' and 'Discard' are the card piles, while 'draw'ing is putting a card in your hand, and 'discard'ing is putting a card on the Discard. ‘They’ can mean he/she. Cooking is activating the effects of cards. Using is using to be short. Don’t take ‘Fride’, ‘Oven’ and ‘Cabinet’ literally. *Just read the rules!*

##           Doing Things

You need to do some things to get the Marshy- mallow Hat. Players must follow the effects of cards, use their seasonings, and give their seasonings to the next player. Keep in mind, cards don't literally do things, you do their effects.

Also, effects of cards can do just about anything. So, even though many things have default behavior, you will do everything a card says. If a card does not mention something, apply the default (normal) effects of things.

##           Seasonings

When a player gets the Open Seasoning, they put the Seasonings they can use on their plate, and put ones they can't use in the Cabinet. Normally, any player can use only Seasonings with**out** 'Extra' or 'Gone' in their title, but effects can change that. Seasonings are used tocook cards. When you cook a card, you must do it's effect.

##           Card Labels

All of the cards have a back and a front, except the Manual Cards. The back says King Taco in BIG text and has a '___ card' label, telling you what type of card it is. Draw Cards have a fun name below the image and fun description to the left. The actual effect is below the fun name.
##           Set up

Who ever ate last/ the most will get the Open Seasoning first. First, place the Base cards in the middle, not on top of each other. Put all the Draw, King's Preference, and Super Flavor cards, all face down,  each on their own similar label Base, stacked one card on top of another similar one.

This makes 3 decks. Second, put a King's Preference card face down on King Taco. Third, give each a player a Plate, and the Fridge and Oven of the same color. Also, give each player 7 Draw cards to start the game.

##           Where Cards Go

Card type-&gt;where it goes when you cook it: Action-&gt;your Oven , Crepeture-&gt;plate , Super Flavor-&gt;Super Flavor discard , King's Preference -&gt;King's Preference Discard , Reaction-&gt; Card affected , Discarded card -&gt;your Oven .

When you put a Crepeture on a  Plate, you discard all cards there before. 

##           Passing Seasonings

When you use a Seasoning, give it to the next player. You must use all seasonings with Play (let you cook Actions.) and Draw (let you draw from your Fridge) in their names, and then use ones with Spawn (let you cook Crepetures), and then use the Open Seasoning. Normally, the next player is on your left, meaning the direction of play is clockwise.
##           Fridge and Oven

Your ‘Fridge’ and ‘Oven’ are each a deck (stack on a Base) of cards, but they are not always the same deck. Effects will change where your Fridge/Oven is. With no effects, your Fridge is the Draw, and you Oven is the Discard. You must move your Fridge &amp; your Oven when they are changed by an effect. Usually, you draw from your Fridge.
##           0 Cards to Win

If you have no cards in your hand when you use the Draw Seasoning, you must draw seven (7) cards, and draw a Super Flavor from it's Draw. The Super Flavor can be cooked, like other Draw cards.

The Super Flavor cards all have the same effect, and unique flavor labels on the side. The label says what the Super Flavor card's flavor is.  King's Preference cards have this label too.

####The Super Flavor Cards’ effect:

Flip the King's Preference on King Taco to be face up.

-If the flavor of the King's Preference and this card have the same flavor, then you may draw the Marshymallow Hat (and win!).

-Else, if they do **not** have the same flavor, then do this: **1st**, search the King's Preference Draw for the card that has the same flavor as this card. **2nd**, discard this card, and the King's Preference that is the same flavor as this (that you just found).

##           The Cards Explain Themselves

But, if you need, here is some extra explanations:

,boardgames,"Hey all! 

I've been working on a Mario Kart style racing game for the past couple of years called Reckless Overdrive. I’m nearing the home stretch to self publish it on Kickstarter, but with what was supposed to be convention season coming up, I'm pretty bummed I’ll be missing out on a lot of playtesting and watching new people experiencing the game for the first time.  

So I've put together a Tabletop Simulator version for people to check out instead. It would be awesome if anyone checked it out and left some playtest feedback, but honestly, I just want people to play it and have fun!

RECKLESS OVERDRIVE is a fast-paced, push your luck racing game full of wacky characters, abilities, and items. Drive as fast as you want, but the faster you go, the more damage you might take! Outwit your opponents by choosing when to attack, boost or dodge all while trying to stay ahead of the pack. The fastest car wins the race, but only if it survives!

Playtime: 45min

Players: 3-8

,boardgames,"[The collection](https://imgur.com/gallery/5V4kT43)

Time in the hobby: 
5 years, though I played Catan with my family growing up in the 90's. My parents picked up a few other games in my teens, like Puerto Rico and Robo Rally. But no one wanted to learn the rules, and they sat collecting dust for years. I got married 6 years ago (anniversary was last week) and a year into our marriage my wife and I wanted to have a hobby together. Our friends picked us up from an air port and just gushed about this new game they had played, betrayal at house on the hill, and after discovering Will Wheaton's Tabletop, we settled on boardgames. It's been quite the journey since.

What would I change about my collection:
Expansions. I'd prefer to expand on the games I have than get too many new ones, with a few exceptions.  Our shelves are pretty full right now, plus I just got laid off due to Covid, so money's a little tight. 

What I've been playing:
My wife is my partner in all things, gaming or otherwise, and we've really been enjoying Empyreal: Spells and Steam since receiving it in February. It pushed scythe out as our midweight engine builder. And although we haven't played it as much this year, we both really like spirit island. We've also gotten tabletop simulator and been playing with my siblings, who are all over the country. We've played Root on Thursday for the last 2 weeks, and it's been a real hit

,boardgames,"Empyreal Spells and Steam Review: Ticket to Rack Your Brain  

**First Impressions**

Empyreal Spells and Steam started as a roller coaster for me. I backed it on Kickstarter based on the designer alone. Argent being one of my favorite games and Harvest offering so much in a small package, I was sure Trey Chambers could do no wrong. After the funding period ended, I started reading more about the game, watching some playthroughs, and feeling a little buyer’s remorse. After all, it was pretty pricey, looked like it could be a bear to learn, and the designer himself said that it wasn’t very interactive compared to Argent (something I look for in my games).

I stuck with my pledge. Was it the right decision?

In Level99 fashion, this game is lavishly produced and beautiful. I’m not actually big on the Indines World as a theme, but being able to say “because magic” helps with rules explanations. Once you internalize how many captains, companies, spellcars, and specialists are in the box, you cannot help but get a little giddy.

**Gameplay**

The rules explanation was so quick, I wondered if there was going to be much to write home about in the gameplay.

Most turns are also quick. Either you move your pawn to the right on your player board and build track by placing trains on the board or you get your mana (currency) back and refresh your special abilities or you deliver goods and choose 1 of 3 bonuses. Your goal is to build an engine on your individual player board, maneuver through that engine at the correct pace (it’s really a race), and make deliveries that will get you bonuses and sometimes steal resources from other players (Again, it’s a race!). 

The meat is in the wide variety of spellcars (the tiles that make up your engine), specialists (special abilities), and positioning on the board (which changes with each game). Your engine will be nothing like your opponent's.

Many turns take about 5 seconds. You will, however, encounter some excruciating turns that make you feel like you have to think several turns ahead. After a few games, you’ll realize that you should be thinking ahead at all times.

In the end, you add up your resources and bonus tiles and that’s it. Scoring takes less than a minute, which is a huge plus.

**Review**

Set-up is snappy (besides putting the resources on the board), teaching the game is snappy, and playing the game is snappy. Each game lasts about 30 minutes per player, but feels as fulfilling as a longer, meatier game. Not only that, but it scales better than any game I have played. I’ve played at 2, 3, 4, and 5. Each of those counts offered their own set of challenges, but downtime never felt like an issue as you are always interested in what others are doing…that is if you aren’t busy planning out your next couple of turns.

The tension throughout this game is agonizing. Even those quick turns can have far-reaching implications that can leave you beating yourself up 30 minutes later, and I really enjoy that. I think that while the game may be considered medium weight, the skill ceiling is pretty high because there are so many different aspects to balance. Unlike Argent, however, my brain doesn’t feel quite as dead after playing Empyreal. There’s a time and place for that, but it is not as often as the time and place for Empyreal, which can be any day of the week.

Did I mention the replayability? I have not even begun to scratch the surface of variety and replayability in this game. 65 spellcars, 6 double-sides map boards, 8 captains, 45 specialists, etc. etc. etc. No two games are going to feel anything alike.

This game is more interactive than it seems at first glance. You’re often racing to deliver the same goods off the same hexes as the other players, but there are also some devious ways to steal things out from under them or throw a wrench in their engine.

Cons: You'll need to reference the manual for specialists and certain spellcars. Reference sheets should have been included. Also, the box is too big. Way too big.

In summary, this game is shooting up the ranks into my all-time favorites. The tension, replayability, scalability, and thinky-ness are top notch. I should have known that Trey and Level99 would deliver such a treat. This may be Trey’s magnum opus. I cannot wait to find a copy of the expansion.

One final note is that there's a really good TTS implementation of it.

,boardgames,"*‘And in the end the burgesses passed that remarkable law which is told of by traders in Hatheg and discussed by travellers in Nir; namely, that in Ulthar no man may kill a cat.’*

*The Cats of Ulthar Card Game* is a quick 2 player card game that features a mixture of Push Your Luck, Take That and Pattern Building mechanics. Each player takes on the role of a Spellcaster, who must compete to be the first to surround themselves with a trio of magical cats and kill the moggy-mutilating Cotter and his Wife.

In H.P. Lovecraft’s short story The Cats of Ulthar, an evil cotter (farmer) and his wife are renowned for trapping and killing cats. One day some wandering travellers (who, of course, worship strange and terrible gods) enter the town of Ulthar, and one of their cats goes missing. When the travellers leave, all the town's cats suddenly disappear, and a week later the cotter and his wife are found in their cottage; ‘two cleanly picked human skeletons on the earthen floor, and a number of singular beetles crawling in the shadowy corners.’

There can be no doubt that the tabletop gaming market is (over?)saturated with Cthulhu Mythos/Lovecraftian content at the moment, which makes the fact that Gilgamesh Games have managed to locate a wonderful original theme among these overfished waters all the more impressive. There are no token references to Cthulhu, Innsmouth or the Necronomicon here, but there is a whole litter of adorably savage and delightfully deranged kitties…

[An example playing area, showing off the wonderful artwork!](https://preview.redd.it/abt79gz3rkx41.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dd12131c3012f476e6f01845ae451d3da949d63)

**Gameplay**

To begin, players sit opposite each other and place the ‘Cotter + Wife’ card in between them. The youngest and oldest player each get a corresponding Spellcaster card, the opening hands of 4 Player cards are dealt, and you’re ready to kill/conjure some cats!

The objective of the game is to be the first player to surround their Spellcaster card with 3 cats and then destroy the cotter and his wife with a Kill card. On a turn, players can either play a Cat card from their hand or attack the other player and their cats with a magical Spell card.

When playing a Cat card, the player must ensure that the colour and number of a cat symbol on the Cat card being played matches one of the cat symbols on their Spellcaster card. There are also Mystic Cats which can flout the placement rules. After a cat has been played, the nasty ol’ cotter and wife get a turn! The active player draws a card from the Cotter + Wife deck and immediately resolves it. These cards can be fortunate/unfortunate for either player, featuring such gorgeously dark occurrences as ‘the oldest player’s cat in slot 3 is made into a pie’ and ‘the youngest player’s cat in slot 1 is fed to pigs’.

If a player chooses to attack with a Spell card, such as the Disintegration Spell or Freezing Spell, and their opponent can’t deflect it with a Spell card of their own, then the poor cat in question is killed. However, by killing a cat, the attacking player summons the wrath of the Ancient Elder Gods and must draw a card from the corresponding deck and resolve its effects. These Elder God cards, like the Cotter + Wife cards, can cut both ways and often result in a huge switch-up in the flow of the game.

Play continues with alternating turns until a player successfully surrounds their spellcaster with cats and slams Kill card on the revolting cotter and his wife.

**My Thoughts**

The most striking thing about the game is the amazing artwork by Dave Youkovich. His illustrations are compelling, cute and creepy all at the same time, and are pretty unique when compared to the generic illustrations of many Lovecraft inspired games. The iconography on the cards is really clear too, although the lovely foil finish that came as a Kickstarter stretch goal did make the text on the cards hard to read when viewed from across a table. *Cats of Ulthar* draws a dollop of inspiration from the hugely popular *Exploding Kittens*; both are fast-playing, feline-flaying card games that feature a constant to-and-fro of attacks and card switching fun. However, *Cats of Ulthar* definitely does enough with its striking theme and deceptively simple mechanics to set itself apart.

There are plenty of cards and card combinations that pull the rug out from under you and drastically change the direction of the game. For example, you might have 3 cats surrounding your Spellcaster and be ready to cast the crucial Kill card when your opponent uses a Spell to kill one of your cats, and THEN switches hands with you if the Zizzagor Ancient Elder God card is drawn (an IRL example!). However, key to the success of these frequent turnarounds is that it doesn't ever take too long to build up your array of 3 cats, and so while it can be startling that your plans have been thwarted, you can soon be back on track. This prevents the drastic swings of the game from ever becoming annoying or tiresome.

The game is for 2 players only, which is really its biggest gift and curse. A gift, because the 2-player count is essential in providing that focused tug-of-war duelling experience. A curse, because this may limit the appeal of the game to those who tend to play solo or in larger groups. Here in Cthulhu Towers, however, *The Cats of Ulthar Card Game* has been an instant hit. It is easy to teach, quick to play (15-20 minutes as stated on the box is accurate) and features a delightful mix of strategy (good hand management and a sense of timing are key) and luck (not getting cosmically shafted by the Ancient Elder Gods). The game is also highly portable, coming in a robust little box not much bigger than the size of the cards, which makes it ideal for wandering travellers such as myself. (N.B. for sleeving enthusiasts: once sleeved, the cards don't fit in the box sadly). *The Cats of Ulthar Card Game* is a dynamic and concise experience that will appeal to anyone who is a fan of fast-playing card games, macabre horror themes, or has strong love/hate feelings about cats.

I'm really keen to hear what the community thinks of this one! Does it do enough to stand out from the generic pack? I've been surprised at the lack of discussion around this cool little game, which maybe is to be expected from a Kickstarter project from a small publisher, but I think it effectively hits a sweet spot between two inordinately popular things; Lovecraft and cats!

,boardgames,"We played a four person campaign. The starting factions were Rusviet, Crimean, Saxony, and Polania. The Rusviet player won the first three episodes. None of them were particularly decisive. At the fourth episode, he became a new faction, which then allowed all of us to change our factions. I chose Rusviet.

I won every episode after that, tying one of them with the Polania player. So, literally, Rusviet won every single episode. Some of them were close and came down to a turn, but I thought it was very interesting, and perhaps indicative of potential imbalance. I have played Scythe several times (first time for all us in the campaign, however) and have never noticed an issue with Rusviet winning before, but this was quite a surprise.

Overall, we really enjoyed the campaign and the different scenarios that forced us to adjust our strategies. The Rusviet ability to transport to the factory proved to be extremely valuable for me in the episodes where it was allowed. I liked the story, simple yet engaging enough to hold our interest. We did not read the full 6 pages or whatever it was of backstory, but we read the pre-episode write-ups.

The tech mods were interesting and really changed things up. The mech mods, however, were never anything we really wanted. I do have concerns that mods reward those who fared well rather than providing a catch up mechanism for those who were struggling through the campaign. If I earned 100 coins in an episode and was able to purchase two mods vs someone who earned 75 and could only purchase one, then it can become a situation of the rich getting richer and further putting the campaign out of reach.

The scoring of the final episode was something like 325 for me. 306 for the 2nd place. High 200s for the 3rd place, and mid 200s for the last place player, who also happened to end the final game knowing that it was out of reach for him.

I'd love to hear thoughts from others if you felt Rusviet has a balance issue or not, and whether you felt the campaign rewards were fair.

This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post. You can see previous versions of this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/search?q=%22%2Fr%2Fboardgames+Daily+Discussion+and+Game+Recommendations%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). 

If you are seeking game recommendations you will get better responses if you give us enough background to help you. You can use [this template](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer) to do so. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template) is a version with explanations of what we're looking for.  

Help people identify your game suggestions easily by bolding the game names. It's easy! Just surround the game name with two asterisks (\*\*) and it will show up bold. If you reply to any comment that has a game name in **bold** with ""**/u/r2d8 getparentinfo**"", one of our robots will tell you more about the game

Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.

Also, as an aside, if you kill an intruder on the board does that model and intruder token get returned to the pool of available aliens, or is it out of the game forever? i.e. if we kill all 8 Adult models over the coarse of the game is that it for adults?

My Collection:  [https://imgur.com/a/LDmChRy](https://imgur.com/a/LDmChRy) 

The plastic bins on bottom right shelf are my Marvel Legendary collection. The plastic bins on shelf above it are Sagrada, Killer Bunnies and Bang!

&amp;#x200B;

*How long have I been in the hobby*: I have played games like Monopoly and Life all my life except for a few dry years when I didn’t have anyone to really play with. I’ve had some of my games for a while (like 10 years) but I would say that most of my collection has been gathered in the last 2-3 years. I have two kids 8 and 6 that I play a lot of games with and meet up with a board game group as often as I can as well. 

*What I would change*: I just got a few new games so I am pretty happy. Because I play a lot with my kids there are a lot of light and easier games. I bet there are some genres or heavier games I am missing. Even though I have played games for a long time I feel really new at it still and think there are things I simply haven’t discovered yet. What kinds of games do you see missing? What kinds of things should I try to play to see if I like it?

My top three games: 

Marvel Legendary. I discovered this one about 2 years ago and have collected it ever since. I have all the expansions except the phase 1 base set.

Shadows over Camelot. A fun cooperative game with a potential traitor mechanic that I played a fair amount in college but hasn’t seen the table too much lately, but I think it will when the kids get older.

Valeria Card Kingdoms. An easy to learn tableau building game that I played at a game night. I enjoyed it so much I bought it within a couple days.

Games I have backed on Kickstarter:

Marvel United

Dinogenics and its expansion controlled chaos

Trekking the world

GPS, Sequoia, Mountain Goats

“How long have you been involved in the hobby?”:

About 4 years if you don’t count Risk and Monopoly lol. Converted from 40k.

“What would you change about your collection if you could?”:

I would like more games to play with my wife 1v1. Strategic Train and map games are a hit!

Favourite game:

Likely Terraforming Mars or Scythe.

Newest Game:

Amerikabomber Evil Queen of the Skies (for some COVID solo gaming) and Cartographers. Currently waiting on High Frontier IV, 18Chesepeake, and Pax Pamir 2nd Edition Kickstarters.

Shell of Shame (Games not Played):

Sekigahara (I really think war games are cool but I can never get 1v1 games to the table).

Tapestry (I got this for my birthday and would really like to give it a try. I heard a lot of negative things after getting it though)

Conquest of Paradise (almost on the table 4x will get there though!)

Board game Suggestions:

I would love to have more strategic and more short games that I could play 1v1 with my wife. Games with trains and maps have been a big hit.

Wargaming and Historical gaming has been really interesting to me. Any suggestions on multiplayer games of that nature?

I’m also looking for another drawing game and a trivia game.

,boardgames,"Hi All,

I've read a bunch of the posts on the pros and cons of new players choosing the original Pandemic vs Pandemic Legacy (Season 1). I made my choice, and opted to purchase Pandemic Legacy since it seemed like I could opt to play it like the regular Pandemic before starting on the regular campaign, which is what we plan to do.

The Pandemic Legacy manual alludes to this, and tells you to ignore a bunch of concepts (ie. Objectives, Funding, Panic, etc.) and play without them to experience the base game. However, reading the manual for the first time, it can be confusing to try to understand what the gameplay actually looks like (ie. having to go down the page and omit a bunch of stuff mentally, plus all of the missing rule stickers, before playing the campaign, and try to piece it together).

Also, there are some concepts where it is ambiguous what I'm supposed to be doing. Examples:

* The manual tells me to ignore ""Funding"" in a base game, but funding seems to determine how many events we use. In the absence of funding, how do I choose how many?
* The manual says we win via accomplishing the objectives, but also tells us to ignore ""objectives"" in a base game. So then how do we win?

Is there a recommendation to make this easier to understand the first time? Find a copy of the original Pandemic manual? Some tips, or an online article?

,boardgames,"So first, I get that there is an existing (small) wargaming subreddit at /r/hexandcounter. But I'm wondering what the general attitude here on this subreddit is.

When I say ""wargaming"" here I'm really talking about historical boardgaming - historical conflict simulation boardgames produced by GMT, Compass Games, Decision Games, Multiman Publishing etc etc. Things like Twilight Struggle, Combat Commander, Empire of the Sun, Undaunted, Conflict of Heroes, Advanced Squad Leader, COIN games, etc. I'm **not** talking about miniatures games like Armada/X-wing, Warhammer, etc. 

What I'd like to get a feel for is whether discussions about wargames are really welcome here - they *are* an established genre of boardgames, after all, so they should fall under this subreddit's remit. I just don't see many posts about them here beyond the ""Thursdays at War"" post, so are people just thinking that discussions about them aren't welcome here or are somehow off-topic? Are people actively hostile to wargaming here? When I posted a session report last week it was interesting to see that it seemed to be fluctuating quite wildly in terms of votes, as if some people thought that it shouldn't be there and were downvoting it while others were fine with it being there and appreciated it.

I don't really see a reason to exclude wargaming (historical boardgaming) from this subreddit anyway. And I'm sure there's plenty of 'mainstream' boardgamers who are interested in historical boardgaming but who don't want to ask on established wargaming forums because in my experience anyway they can be pretty intimidating and unwelcoming towards newcomers - so it'd be nice to be able to discuss them more openly here. 

Any thoughts? I'd like to get a discussion going on this. And if you are interested in historical wargames then make yourselves known! Maybe it'll show there's an interest here (or not, as the case may be). :)",t2_gxjeu,False,,0,False,Wargaming on the boardgaming subreddit?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Question'}]",r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gfazz0,False,dark,0.8,,public,38,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,38,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1588901314.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So first, I get that there is an existing (small) wargaming subreddit at &lt;a href=""/r/hexandcounter""&gt;/r/hexandcounter&lt;/a&gt;. But I&amp;#39;m wondering what the general attitude here on this subreddit is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say &amp;quot;wargaming&amp;quot; here I&amp;#39;m really talking about historical boardgaming - historical conflict simulation boardgames produced by GMT, Compass Games, Decision Games, Multiman Publishing etc etc. Things like Twilight Struggle, Combat Commander, Empire of the Sun, Undaunted, Conflict of Heroes, Advanced Squad Leader, COIN games, etc. I&amp;#39;m &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; talking about miniatures games like Armada/X-wing, Warhammer, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;d like to get a feel for is whether discussions about wargames are really welcome here - they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; an established genre of boardgames, after all, so they should fall under this subreddit&amp;#39;s remit. I just don&amp;#39;t see many posts about them here beyond the &amp;quot;Thursdays at War&amp;quot; post, so are people just thinking that discussions about them aren&amp;#39;t welcome here or are somehow off-topic? Are people actively hostile to wargaming here? When I posted a session report last week it was interesting to see that it seemed to be fluctuating quite wildly in terms of votes, as if some people thought that it shouldn&amp;#39;t be there and were downvoting it while others were fine with it being there and appreciated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really see a reason to exclude wargaming (historical boardgaming) from this subreddit anyway. And I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s plenty of &amp;#39;mainstream&amp;#39; boardgamers who are interested in historical boardgaming but who don&amp;#39;t want to ask on established wargaming forums because in my experience anyway they can be pretty intimidating and unwelcoming towards newcomers - so it&amp;#39;d be nice to be able to discuss them more openly here. &lt;/p&gt;

**How long have you been in the hobby?**

About 3 years now. I went from games where you painted miniatures (*Warhammer*) to games with prepainted miniatures (*XWing*) to *CMON* miniature games which opened up boardgames as a whole. Once I realized that there are very strategic/tactical games that hold my attention I dove in. About 6 months into a hobby, I developed a beer and board game night with another dad in my neighborhood.

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

Venture beyond the comfortable and be less of a board game snob where I gravitate to what I know and look past what may be cheesy box art. I've been more open to demos from my local game shop and tried generes I never tried before. If I would have stuck only to miniature based tactical games I would never have discovered Time Stories, Arkham Horror LCG, or Terraforming Mars.

**Games in my collection**

*Games just added:*

* Chuthulu: Death May Die
* Crokinole

*Favorite top five games in my collection:*

1. *Scythe* (and expansions): My groups default game. Very tactical but incorporates engine building and resource management. So many ways to win. No game is the same. Art and models are beautiful.
2. *Zombicide Black Plague*: Sometimes you just need to blow up zombies with a fireball. Quick to learn, but still makes you think tactically, but any skill set can pick it up while you drink and laugh.
3. *Rum and Bones (Second Tide)*: This was the game that made me jump to boardgames. Art is gorgeous, models are beautiful, theme is great. The special abilities of different factions are unique and a lot of fun. The only knock would be is it really doesn't play well beyond two. But a head to head game is awesome.
4. *Arkham Horror LCG*: Theme, art, story are all fantastic. Fantastic as co-op or single player. It's amazing how the chapters are so different and introduce new mechanics that always make the game new. Only issue is I'm tired of Cuthulu usually winning and chewing on my skull as he giggles.
5. *Cosmic Encounters*: Quick to pick up, but dynamic with expansions so it doesn't get boring. I love the fact you could be helping your friend one round and attacking him the next. All skill levels love this game and it's a lot of fun with a group of friends who are over for the evening.

&amp;#x200B;

*Honorable Mention:*

* Time Stories, Azul, Tapestry, Lord of the Ring: Journeys in the Middle Earth

&amp;#x200B;

*Favorite Hex and Counter:*

* Enemy Coast Ahead: The Doolittle Raid
* Battles of the American Revolution: Guilford

**Prized Possession:**

""*Most Hated Player of the Year*"" framed picture on my shelf. I have a picture of each of my gaming friends. Whenever I lose to someone by a point or two, I change out the picture to the person I lost to.

**Game I  have the biggest beef with:**

*Terraforming Mars.* I have a love/hate relationship with the game. I love the concept and love to play it, but the quality fo materials and art are horrendous. 

**Game I just can't get people to play:**

My gf and I had our anniversary recently, and being the amazing partner that she is she bought me a boardgame that perfectly intersects my interests of spaceflight, math, and boardgames - Leaving Earth.

It's a pure joy for me to play, and I've asked her to play one game with me cooperatively so she can get a feel for the game. We're playing tonight, but I'm worried that she may have difficulty grasping the mechanics of the game. She's a smart woman, but math is not her forté, and algebra makes up the bulk of the gameplay. How can I explain the core concepts in a legible way without losing her on the math? What tasks can I delegate to her during play so she feels engaged and has fun?

It’s been roughly 8 weeks since I saw a post by u/-JeremyBearimy- on his/her new Crokinole Board by Wooden You Know. I had met the owners months ago at Dragoncon and got hooked during a demo. I couldn't get a board at the time but this post kicked me in the pants and I ordered one.

Except Reddit loved them to death. I wasn't the only one that had the idea after the post and I got in a loooong queue. Poor owners didn't know what Reddit was, they only knew they suddenly had a lot of orders. But they learned fast and started answering questions online (/u/WYKCrokinole).

I need to relay the wonderful experience I had and some observations.

*  I LOVE the fact that they made these boards so they can be displayed on your wall. Just install the anchors in the wall and hang it on display.
* The fact I can store the discs within the back of the board is awesome.
* The lines are inlaid. He routed out the scoring lines, filled with copper colored epoxy, and sanded them smooth.

But what impressed me the most is I have no less than 20 e-mails where I went back and forth with the owner's wife about making my board unique. Sending me pictures of different color epoxy resin for the inlay, running to home depot to pick up supplies for an experiment to see how it looked before sending me pictures, etc.

,boardgames,"So for the past month, every time I have played with my brother, he has won every game. Whether it’s Western Legends, Power Grid, Race for the Galaxy, Eclipse or Blood Rage, he somehow manages to win them all. 

The last game we played was Blood Rage. I didn’t focus on winning but rather tried to sabotage him by always attacking him so he could lose but he still managed to win somehow! From gaining glory from releasing his warriors from Valhalla to purposefully losing battles while playing his Loki cards to steal rage, he managed to get the better of me.

We usually play with 4-5 players so it’s actually quite impressive that he ends up winning them all but annoying at the same time. His wife and I are now discussing about maybe teaming up against him next game we play just so he won’t win anymore. 

Have any of you experienced this? Someone somehow always managing to win games? What do you guys suggest? Should I play to win or play to make sure he loses? Either way, I still have fun but now I have a vendetta to fulfill..

EDIT: So I’m not sure if I didn’t convey this correctly but I’m not at all angry or bitter with my brother. A little annoyed that he has been winning all the time? Yeah sure. But there aren’t any hard feelings. I mean this was posted under humor after all. 

Our gaming group consists of family and friends and we all banter and talk smack to each other. You should see us when we play Avalon/Resistance.

This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template) is a version with explanations of what we're looking for.  

Help people identify your game suggestions easily by bolding the game names. It's easy! Just surround the game name with two asterisks (\*\*) and it will show up bold. If you reply to any comment that has a game name in **bold** with ""**/u/r2d8 getparentinfo**"", one of our robots will tell you more about the game

,boardgames,"I've been on the fence about getting a proper Kallax unit for ages as they're fairly pricey and that always seemed like money I could be spending on actual games (or rent or whatever). As such my partner and I had two mismatched bookcases with everything just sort of piled in. The [end result](https://imgur.com/a/yqmc4bw) was that it gave the impression that the collection was the result of a lack of impulse control and we were struggling to find room for it all. If nothing else, the Kallax makes it look like we bought a lot of board games on purpose.

[Link to the pic, cat tax included.](https://imgur.com/a/wROXIV6)

Whilst it was still a bit pricey compared to just making do with odds and ends I've got to say I'm really glad we took the time to present it all properly. It's probably a bit less intimidating to the uninitiated as well. The drawers in the middle ended up being used for small games (Love Letter, Dobble etc) that we were worried would fall down the back of the unit if left on a shelf!

Questions:

*How long have you been in the hobby?* About 7-8 years, going from a half size book case to a full size one, then to a full size one with a half size next to it, then to two full size ones, then finally to this. Games have come and gone a lot though, and the last year and a half I've been trying to cultivate a really tight collection where whatever game someone picks out and says ""can we play this?"" I know I'll be up for it.

*What would you change about your collection?* I've been focussing a lot on 2 player games so would definitely grow that section further.

*Are all your games picture here?* No, games designated as 'party games' are kept in an ottoman in the living room so that we can crack them out when we have a house party. We only keep 'games night' games on the Kallax itself.

*Do the cats play games with you?* Yes, Dustin in particular loves dice and helping me roll them. Jake has a habit of eating plastic so we try to keep him at bay but he's usually content to sit in the lid whilst we play.

*Any there that you haven't played yet?* Of the ones on display it's only really Escape From Colditz and Risk that I haven't played. Risk is basically a family heirloom I don't have much interest in but it has sentimental value to a particular family member so I look after it. Escape From Colditz just never seems to have the interest from my regular gaming groups. Go figure.

*Favourite Game?* Cosmic Encounter for me, I think my girlfriend's favourite is Consulting Detective but she changes her mind a lot!

*Why don't you have X? It's great!* It probably is, but as I mentioned we've been trying to limit the collection to only the games that we're always up for playing. We've had quite a few games that have ended up in maths trades or on ebay because they're good but there's a similar game that does it better. Best example is Stone Age which we liked but it was too similar to Lords of Waterdeep, and if we're always going to pick Lords of Waterdeep when we want a longer worker placement game then we're never going to play Stone Age so what's the point in keeping it?

*What's with the order you've put them in?* That was a brainwave I had. They're sorted in order of maximum player count, starting with two player games in the top left then going in columns through 4 player, 5 player, 6 player, then 7 or more players. The idea is that if there's five people to play games we can point at the sections for 2 and 4 player games and say ""those are out, but the rest are fair game"" it's a lot easier than having people pull one out at random and say ""how about this?"" only for us to say there are too many of us to play it. Streamlined games nights a lot, especially with newcomers to the hobby.

*How regularly do you play?* We have a weekly game night (which has now migrated to Tabletopia thanks to the pandemic), and we have a bunch of friends who are casually in to the hobby who come and go throughout the average week. A lot of the time my partner and I just play together of an evening, hence the high number of dedicated two player games and the general reluctance to get anything we can't play with just two.

EDIT - Found a recent photo of the previous storage arrangement and added it for the curious.",t2_nkvmv,False,,0,False,[COMC] After much umming and aahing over it we decided to invest in a proper Kallax for storage,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'COMC'}]",r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gese6k,False,dark,0.73,,public,54,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},COMC,False,54,,False,self,1588851564.0,pandemic,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Pandemic'}]",{},,True,,1588827371.0,richtext,6,,,richtext,self.boardgames,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been on the fence about getting a proper Kallax unit for ages as they&amp;#39;re fairly pricey and that always seemed like money I could be spending on actual games (or rent or whatever). As such my partner and I had two mismatched bookcases with everything just sort of piled in. The &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/yqmc4bw""&gt;end result&lt;/a&gt; was that it gave the impression that the collection was the result of a lack of impulse control and we were struggling to find room for it all. If nothing else, the Kallax makes it look like we bought a lot of board games on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/wROXIV6""&gt;Link to the pic, cat tax included.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst it was still a bit pricey compared to just making do with odds and ends I&amp;#39;ve got to say I&amp;#39;m really glad we took the time to present it all properly. It&amp;#39;s probably a bit less intimidating to the uninitiated as well. The drawers in the middle ended up being used for small games (Love Letter, Dobble etc) that we were worried would fall down the back of the unit if left on a shelf!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How long have you been in the hobby?&lt;/em&gt; About 7-8 years, going from a half size book case to a full size one, then to a full size one with a half size next to it, then to two full size ones, then finally to this. Games have come and gone a lot though, and the last year and a half I&amp;#39;ve been trying to cultivate a really tight collection where whatever game someone picks out and says &amp;quot;can we play this?&amp;quot; I know I&amp;#39;ll be up for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What would you change about your collection?&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;ve been focussing a lot on 2 player games so would definitely grow that section further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are all your games picture here?&lt;/em&gt; No, games designated as &amp;#39;party games&amp;#39; are kept in an ottoman in the living room so that we can crack them out when we have a house party. We only keep &amp;#39;games night&amp;#39; games on the Kallax itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do the cats play games with you?&lt;/em&gt; Yes, Dustin in particular loves dice and helping me roll them. Jake has a habit of eating plastic so we try to keep him at bay but he&amp;#39;s usually content to sit in the lid whilst we play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any there that you haven&amp;#39;t played yet?&lt;/em&gt; Of the ones on display it&amp;#39;s only really Escape From Colditz and Risk that I haven&amp;#39;t played. Risk is basically a family heirloom I don&amp;#39;t have much interest in but it has sentimental value to a particular family member so I look after it. Escape From Colditz just never seems to have the interest from my regular gaming groups. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Favourite Game?&lt;/em&gt; Cosmic Encounter for me, I think my girlfriend&amp;#39;s favourite is Consulting Detective but she changes her mind a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why don&amp;#39;t you have X? It&amp;#39;s great!&lt;/em&gt; It probably is, but as I mentioned we&amp;#39;ve been trying to limit the collection to only the games that we&amp;#39;re always up for playing. We&amp;#39;ve had quite a few games that have ended up in maths trades or on ebay because they&amp;#39;re good but there&amp;#39;s a similar game that does it better. Best example is Stone Age which we liked but it was too similar to Lords of Waterdeep, and if we&amp;#39;re always going to pick Lords of Waterdeep when we want a longer worker placement game then we&amp;#39;re never going to play Stone Age so what&amp;#39;s the point in keeping it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;#39;s with the order you&amp;#39;ve put them in?&lt;/em&gt; That was a brainwave I had. They&amp;#39;re sorted in order of maximum player count, starting with two player games in the top left then going in columns through 4 player, 5 player, 6 player, then 7 or more players. The idea is that if there&amp;#39;s five people to play games we can point at the sections for 2 and 4 player games and say &amp;quot;those are out, but the rest are fair game&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s a lot easier than having people pull one out at random and say &amp;quot;how about this?&amp;quot; only for us to say there are too many of us to play it. Streamlined games nights a lot, especially with newcomers to the hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How regularly do you play?&lt;/em&gt; We have a weekly game night (which has now migrated to Tabletopia thanks to the pandemic), and we have a bunch of friends who are casually in to the hobby who come and go throughout the average week. A lot of the time my partner and I just play together of an evening, hence the high number of dedicated two player games and the general reluctance to get anything we can&amp;#39;t play with just two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Hey everyone! My name is Sanchez, and I run [Sandwich Bag Games](https://sandwichbaggames.com/), an independent tabletop game publisher.

Our first game, *Gosh Darn Bubbles!*, has recently arrived from our manufacturer, and what better way to start getting it into circulation than with a giveaway on r/boardgames!

*Gosh Darn Bubbles!* is an underwater-themed, treasure-hunting card game. Players earn Treasure by finding and opening Sunken Chests, but watch out! Some Sunken Chests are filled with Bubbles instead of Treasure and will leave you empty-handed. There are lots of clever animals living in the water that will help you find Sunken Chests, but some of the animals are a bit mean and are more interested in making your search as difficult as possible.

*Gosh Darn Bubbles!* is casual &amp; light-hearted, designed for 2-6 players, best suited for ages 14+, takes about 2 minutes to learn, and 5-20 minutes to play. You can learn more and view some of the cards at [www.sandwichbaggames.com](https://sandwichbaggames.com/).

**To enter, respond to this post with the name of your favorite animal that lives in, on, or around water!** 10 winners will be chosen randomly and announced on Friday, May 8th, 2020.

**This giveaway is limited to the United States.** Apologies to my friends around the world!

,boardgames,"**TL;DR:** Nothing takes your mind off things like focusing on a project. These will be 9 boards I've created now (see links just below), and I'm leaving my process here for anyone who may find it useful in the future (ie this is not a plug). Over the years I've generated some crokinole interest and get asked to make boards for people somewhat regularly, so I decided to try and refine a process. The goal is to create a decent, quality board with as little labor as possible to sell to friends/fam/local word of mouth only as a hobby. These were made for friends, and **no I won't be selling copyrighted images**.

I'm finishing up four boards (three done, Badger board still WIP) and thought I'd share a little bit of my journey with everyone/anyone who may be thinking about making their own boards.

Three finished (dog tax included).[https://imgur.com/FlHlkvw](https://imgur.com/FlHlkvw)WIP[https://imgur.com/mXNtc8e](https://imgur.com/mXNtc8e)

Some of you will remember my first circular ditch board that I posted awhile back[https://imgur.com/rDlsL1H](https://imgur.com/rDlsL1H)

Well, unfortunately I learned some hard lessons with that board, and I thought I'd pass on my mistakes to maybe spare others of making the same errors. Many of these are just rookie woodworking mistakes, and I've certainly learned a lot along the way.

**Mistakes made on the original black board:**

1. Don't use solid wood. You can, but it makes the project much more difficult because you need to account for the expansion/contraction of the wood. Ie you need to mount it to the ditch using hardware to allow it to move, much like a solid kitchen table top.
2. Make your glue up perfect if you use a solid board. Mine produced a cupped surface to begin with that I ""fixed"" with kerf cuts on the back side. This was a temporary fix when winter hit and the moisture in the air changed.
3. Don't try to fix cupping. It just doesn't work out. In February I pulled the board off the wall to find that it had cupped SIGNIFICANTLY. By that I mean putting a straight ruler across its surface revealed approximately a 3/8"" difference from each edge to the center (like a taco shell).
4. Don't use a solid piece of plywood for the ditch (cut a circle out in the middle), and seal the back side of the board and ditch as well. There's debate on this among woodworkers I talked to, but the long and short is: it ain't going to hurt, and having both sides the same should in theory absorb moisture equally from both sides of the piece. Having one side unsealed can create an imbalance that could lead to cupping woes.
5. If using an epoxy finish, know the following things.

* Don't cut the center hole before pouring. You'll create a beveled edge that makes scoring 20s easier.
* Use Tuck Tape around the edges to contain the epoxy from running off/over. It does not stick to Tuck Tape.
* If you get soft spots (follow directions exactly to avoid this), or have areas that maybe didn't fill correctly, know that you cannot spot fix. Assume I poured and the epoxy wasn't enough to cover the surface all the way to the edge of the board. When it cured I poured that edge and sanded it flush. This doesn't work. You will have a bright glossy line where the two pours meet.
* Yes you can rub out the surface the same as poly, and it is super slick. I'm on the fence about whether it's more easily scratched. I think it may be.

So all of the above led to my solid wood board cupping really bad in the winter, and it was not fixable. I did manage to salvage the ditch. Knowing I was going to be making a new board, I decided to make a batch to experiment with a new process. Side note: The Captain America board is a gift for a friend of mine who I call Captain due to him being a firefighter, first responder, backup SWAT. I'm pretty stoked to surprise him with it.

I've now made 9 boards, and each batch was a little different than the last. I think I finally have a better process down for the next time, but won't know until after I make them that way. The following is the process for the new batch. Tools you'll need: Jigsaw, miter saw or table saw or preferably both. Hand clamps. Strap clamp (see link below). 1 3/8"" hole saw. Drill. Orbital sander.

1. 1/2"" plywood 4'x4' (2 sheets) sanded on one side, raised the grain (wet the surface and let dry), sanded again. 4'x4' is easier to handle, cut from 1 4'x8' sheet.
2. Printed directly onto the plywood at my brother's print shop. Originally I was thinking about a vinyl application, but then I found out his company had this machine that prints directly onto the plywood. It was awesome. Printed them up right before quarantine happened.Some in progress shots:[https://imgur.com/BAHmImP](https://imgur.com/BAHmImP)   [https://imgur.com/DgrwYSF](https://imgur.com/DgrwYSF)   [https://imgur.com/FT73MD0](https://imgur.com/FT73MD0)   [https://imgur.com/JcfjlvX](https://imgur.com/JcfjlvX)
3. The plywood is held in place with a vacuum table, so the sheets have to be pretty flat. A big print head zips across the surface. Probably painted each 4x4 sheet in a matter of 5-10 mins maybe. It lays down white ahead of the full color ink so that the color will stay true on darker wood. I set up the files in Illustrator. Printing cost less than $5 per circle, and the owner said I'm welcome to come back anytime to do more in the future. Which was pretty cool.
4. Cut the circles out with a jigsaw. Use a blade that produces a clean cut to prevent tearing the edges. You can also tape the edges with painters tape.
5. Varnish with poly. 10-12 coats should be enough.
6. For the ditches I used 1x4s and made an octagon. Pro tip: check your miter saw's cut with a protractor (don't trust its measurement sticker). Set up a jig so that each piece is cut to the same length EXACTLY. You wouldn't believe how the slightest bit of variance screws up the octagon big time, and you need a clean fit to glue it up. Here's a dry fit [https://imgur.com/QBVyjdR](https://imgur.com/QBVyjdR). After sanding the edges I glued up the whole thing at once using this strap clamp (and extra corner pieces).  [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NO6XHZC/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NO6XHZC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)This strap clamp is the shit. I looked into other ways people were making these octagon ditches, and I've tried a couple of their methods. Cutting tongue and grooves is just too much damn work. Pocket screws the same. Some say you need more than glue for these joints. These things are pretty solid. I know I'll get some woodworkers shaking their heads, and that's fine. The joints weren't an issue for me with just glue, and I put them under some stress in the rail clamping.
7. Cut the octagon into a circle using a jig saw. Sand edge
8. Cut rails for ditch. I did the Hilinski method for my first circular ditch, and four half pieces just seemed like too much work. I decided to try to do the rails in one piece. So i cut a 2x4 to a 2"" width and ripped 1/4"" strips from it. I then used an electric hand planer to smooth each side and take them down to about 3/8"". Using a piece of PVC pipe filled with water, I soaked these for a few hours and then carefully bent them around a barrel much like I did the first time for the black board. [https://imgur.com/7Pzrulm](https://imgur.com/7Pzrulm)
9. I glued the rail pieces to the ditches using the strap clamp and hand clamps to close up gaps. You still need a fair number of hand clamps for this, but it worked well enough. Glue on its own without the nails and four pieces is enough. I've carried these by the rails, and they're solid. You just need to make sure you get a solid clamp and don't be afraid to use a liberal amount of glue. Tip: if trying this, put the strap clamp handle where the two pieces of rail meet. On a clock face put this at 6. Put one clamp at 12 after tightening the strap as much as possible, and work your way towards 6 on each side, closing up gaps as you go (clamp at 11 and then 1, 10 then 2, etc).
10. Fill rail gap. 8' was just short (about 1/4"") to cover the entire rail's circumference, so I had to cut a small piece to fill it, and then I use epoxy sculpt filler to hide this and make the rail appear seamless.
11. Sand ditches. I picked up a pneumatic sander so I could wet sand with a machine instead of by hand (and my omni electric sander died anyway). This thing is the shit as well.  [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BQ43K9S/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BQ43K9S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)
12. Rub out playing surfaces. After 30 days the poly is cured. I used 320, 600, and 1200 grit sanding paper with the orbital sander and used a spray bottle to mist the surface for wet sanding, wiping clean after each grit. I did 3 passes with each grit. It once took me a full day to rub out  two boards once. I did 4 in an hour with this pneumatic one. I then used rubbing compound and polish, followed by turtle wax and buffing.
13. The ditches were painted and sealed with poly. If you want to stain them you'll have to do something else about hiding the seam with epoxy sculpt.
14. Attach the playing surface to the ditch. I used screws this time.
15. Make center plug and install screws. I cut a dowel and glued the printed center piece from each board onto it, sealing it with mod podge dimensional magic. This piece is about 1/8""-1/4"" thick, clued to a small piece of scrap, and that is glued onto the backside of the board.
16. Install screws. I cut rubber tubing to put over screws and install those in the playing surface.  [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E6BCV0G/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E6BCV0G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)
17. Forgot a step: install picture frame hanging wire on ditch before attaching board. I used small eye screws and regular picture frame wire.

Mistakes made in this batch or things I will change:

Not everything went smoothly as I was trying out some new processes.

1. Next time I'm going to use Masonite for the playing surface instead. This will be perfectly flat (no warping), no wood grain to worry about for printing on or for applying enough poly coats so you don't sand through, etc. You just have to seal the cut edge, and i was told  a shellac based primerlike Zinsser BIN will work for this.
2. I may make the ditch out of a circular cut piece of plywood. I like the strength of the 1x4 ditch, but it's a lot of steps to make the octagon. However, a plywood ditch will potentially be warped, have more waste, etc. I'm still thinking about this one. Masonite could work, but I'm not sure about that either. I doubt it would hang on the wall without the screws for the picture frame wire pulling out. We'll see.
3. The rails: cutting them out of a 2x4 is a pain in the ass. Aside from all of that and the problems you'll encounter, you're dealing with knotty substandard wood, and it's really a crapshoot what you're going to get. Knots really make bending the rails difficult and they're more prone to crack/split. I found pine boards in the trim section at Menards that are 2"" wide and approximately 3/8"" thick, so I'm going to try those next. Even though they're $6 each, the time i spent cutting, planing, etc is worth it i think.
4. Cut your center hole (and drilled holes for the screws/pegs) last. Don't wet sand after. I nearly had to start over with the finish because the wood grain swelled around the center a bit. That was a big bummer of a night and a hard rookie lesson I should have known better about. Thankfully I was able to sand this down without going through anywhere.
5. When cutting your center hole, put a bunch of painters tape down so you don't ""chew up"" the surface of your board with your hole saw.

If you read all that, I assume you're bookmarking this for later, and I really hope this helps you. I'm sure there are better ways of doing this, but this is my current process which is still being refined. Materials were approximately ~~$60 each~~ $20 each (was thinking of the total cost for 4) give or take $5-10 and not including tools. Believe it or not aside from the plywood the poly accounts for the majority of the cost.

&lt;li&gt;Cut the circles out with a jigsaw. Use a blade that produces a clean cut to prevent tearing the edges. You can also tape the edges with painters tape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Varnish with poly. 10-12 coats should be enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the ditches I used 1x4s and made an octagon. Pro tip: check your miter saw&amp;#39;s cut with a protractor (don&amp;#39;t trust its measurement sticker). Set up a jig so that each piece is cut to the same length EXACTLY. You wouldn&amp;#39;t believe how the slightest bit of variance screws up the octagon big time, and you need a clean fit to glue it up. Here&amp;#39;s a dry fit &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/QBVyjdR""&gt;https://imgur.com/QBVyjdR&lt;/a&gt;. After sanding the edges I glued up the whole thing at once using this strap clamp (and extra corner pieces).  &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NO6XHZC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1""&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NO6XHZC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&lt;/a&gt;This strap clamp is the shit. I looked into other ways people were making these octagon ditches, and I&amp;#39;ve tried a couple of their methods. Cutting tongue and grooves is just too much damn work. Pocket screws the same. Some say you need more than glue for these joints. These things are pretty solid. I know I&amp;#39;ll get some woodworkers shaking their heads, and that&amp;#39;s fine. The joints weren&amp;#39;t an issue for me with just glue, and I put them under some stress in the rail clamping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut the octagon into a circle using a jig saw. Sand edge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut rails for ditch. I did the Hilinski method for my first circular ditch, and four half pieces just seemed like too much work. I decided to try to do the rails in one piece. So i cut a 2x4 to a 2&amp;quot; width and ripped 1/4&amp;quot; strips from it. I then used an electric hand planer to smooth each side and take them down to about 3/8&amp;quot;. Using a piece of PVC pipe filled with water, I soaked these for a few hours and then carefully bent them around a barrel much like I did the first time for the black board. &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/7Pzrulm""&gt;https://imgur.com/7Pzrulm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I glued the rail pieces to the ditches using the strap clamp and hand clamps to close up gaps. You still need a fair number of hand clamps for this, but it worked well enough. Glue on its own without the nails and four pieces is enough. I&amp;#39;ve carried these by the rails, and they&amp;#39;re solid. You just need to make sure you get a solid clamp and don&amp;#39;t be afraid to use a liberal amount of glue. Tip: if trying this, put the strap clamp handle where the two pieces of rail meet. On a clock face put this at 6. Put one clamp at 12 after tightening the strap as much as possible, and work your way towards 6 on each side, closing up gaps as you go (clamp at 11 and then 1, 10 then 2, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill rail gap. 8&amp;#39; was just short (about 1/4&amp;quot;) to cover the entire rail&amp;#39;s circumference, so I had to cut a small piece to fill it, and then I use epoxy sculpt filler to hide this and make the rail appear seamless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sand ditches. I picked up a pneumatic sander so I could wet sand with a machine instead of by hand (and my omni electric sander died anyway). This thing is the shit as well.  &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BQ43K9S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1""&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BQ43K9S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rub out playing surfaces. After 30 days the poly is cured. I used 320, 600, and 1200 grit sanding paper with the orbital sander and used a spray bottle to mist the surface for wet sanding, wiping clean after each grit. I did 3 passes with each grit. It once took me a full day to rub out  two boards once. I did 4 in an hour with this pneumatic one. I then used rubbing compound and polish, followed by turtle wax and buffing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ditches were painted and sealed with poly. If you want to stain them you&amp;#39;ll have to do something else about hiding the seam with epoxy sculpt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attach the playing surface to the ditch. I used screws this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make center plug and install screws. I cut a dowel and glued the printed center piece from each board onto it, sealing it with mod podge dimensional magic. This piece is about 1/8&amp;quot;-1/4&amp;quot; thick, clued to a small piece of scrap, and that is glued onto the backside of the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install screws. I cut rubber tubing to put over screws and install those in the playing surface.  &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E6BCV0G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1""&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E6BCV0G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forgot a step: install picture frame hanging wire on ditch before attaching board. I used small eye screws and regular picture frame wire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistakes made in this batch or things I will change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everything went smoothly as I was trying out some new processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next time I&amp;#39;m going to use Masonite for the playing surface instead. This will be perfectly flat (no warping), no wood grain to worry about for printing on or for applying enough poly coats so you don&amp;#39;t sand through, etc. You just have to seal the cut edge, and i was told  a shellac based primerlike Zinsser BIN will work for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I may make the ditch out of a circular cut piece of plywood. I like the strength of the 1x4 ditch, but it&amp;#39;s a lot of steps to make the octagon. However, a plywood ditch will potentially be warped, have more waste, etc. I&amp;#39;m still thinking about this one. Masonite could work, but I&amp;#39;m not sure about that either. I doubt it would hang on the wall without the screws for the picture frame wire pulling out. We&amp;#39;ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rails: cutting them out of a 2x4 is a pain in the ass. Aside from all of that and the problems you&amp;#39;ll encounter, you&amp;#39;re dealing with knotty substandard wood, and it&amp;#39;s really a crapshoot what you&amp;#39;re going to get. Knots really make bending the rails difficult and they&amp;#39;re more prone to crack/split. I found pine boards in the trim section at Menards that are 2&amp;quot; wide and approximately 3/8&amp;quot; thick, so I&amp;#39;m going to try those next. Even though they&amp;#39;re $6 each, the time i spent cutting, planing, etc is worth it i think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut your center hole (and drilled holes for the screws/pegs) last. Don&amp;#39;t wet sand after. I nearly had to start over with the finish because the wood grain swelled around the center a bit. That was a big bummer of a night and a hard rookie lesson I should have known better about. Thankfully I was able to sand this down without going through anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When cutting your center hole, put a bunch of painters tape down so you don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;chew up&amp;quot; the surface of your board with your hole saw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read all that, I assume you&amp;#39;re bookmarking this for later, and I really hope this helps you. I&amp;#39;m sure there are better ways of doing this, but this is my current process which is still being refined. Materials were approximately &lt;del&gt;$60 each&lt;/del&gt; $20 each (was thinking of the total cost for 4) give or take $5-10 and not including tools. Believe it or not aside from the plywood the poly accounts for the majority of the cost. Thanks for reading, and I hope this helps someone out there.&lt;/p&gt;

,boardgames,"This has been posted on BGG, but I am posting it here both as my thoughts and a sincere desire that Monolith reads it and reacts as I do feel it captures not only my thoughts but echoes much of what I have read about B:GCC before and after playing the game a handful of times. **If you want the TL,DR version, just read the bold lines.**

Dear Monolith,

Let me start by saying that **I am your target audience. I love thematic games. I love DC Comics.** Currently, I'm writing this wearing a lab coat with Superman patches sewed onto it. My game room is decked out in Marvel and DC posters and Funko Pops. I love games with minis and dice if they are well-designed. I also love one vs all games. One of my all-time favorite games is Descent 1st Edition. And I will be referring to that and Descent 2nd Edition (which I hated) often throughout this review as two base points for myself.

**I went all in on this pledge, and it wasn't even a second thought.** From what I saw, this game checked so many boxes for me. I did not buy Conan. I think I backed it and then ended up having it shipped to another person before it ever arrived.

**I had so much faith in the idea that I would love this game that I backed parts of season 2 without playing it.** And when Shut Up and Sit Down released their very ""eh"" review of the game, and hype cooled on this game, I didn't care. I was still excited to play. I had already sent off my minis to be painted. And I was determined to love this game.

**So now I've played it 5 times.** We've played To Sink a City, Deadly Infection (2x), the one with Tusk in the bank, and the one with Deathstroke in the bank. I apologize for not remembering the names here. **The heroes have yet to win a scenario.** Even when we played Deadly Infection last night, back to back, and had serious discussions about what we should have done differently, we still weren't able to win.

What does that mean? Is a game not fun just because you don't win? No, I hope not. Not for me. Am I having fun when I'm playing the game? I think so. I am definitely enjoying playing a game as some of my favorite characters. I enjoy prepping them with the right gadgets, trying to figure out the best moves to make and when to conserve and when to spend energy. I enjoy successes and seeing super-villains retaliate.

**There's so much to love about this game. But there's something wrong with it.**

My group spent a lot of time discussing the game last night after our first play and then after our second try on the same scenario that we still couldn't win. And I think everyone wants to like it. Part of that may be that they know how much money I spent on buying it, having it painted, and just the fact that it's so gorgeous and it seems like everything is right there. So what is the problem?

**I don't know if I have the answer, but I want to try to walk through this mentally, and I welcome other people's input.**

When I play Descent 1st edition, I almost always play as the Overlord. The overlord has monsters in every room, and a earns threat to spend on cards that he draws, and there's tons of dice to be rolled to attack. And with every roll for attack, there's a 1/6 chance that you might miss. There are no rolls for defense.

I love the epic scale of Descent 1st Ed. Each quest is 3-5 hours and the heroes are discovering the game as they go. And it's like a story you're unfolding. Some of the quests are not terribly balanced, but they are almost always fun. Despite the difference in mechanics between Descent 1st Ed and Batman: GCC, they choices are often the same. Does a hero spend his turn running? Fighting a lot? Moving and fighting a little? Resting a little? And the rules can be a bit finicky. But whether you were the hero or the Overlord, you had choices.

As the overlord, you often had a fist full of evil cards you had to choose because your threat was often limited. Do you play a trap? Do you play a curse? Do you spawn more monsters? Do you save up for a more powerful card that might give you an important edge?

Then Descent 2nd Ed came out. It was supposed to be the new improved Descent. I bought it. The missions took about 30-60 minutes. There was no threat. No deck of cards for the overlords. The heroes were largely unchanged, but it didn't feel epic at all. It didn't feel like there were many choices, especially for the Overlord. I hated it and sold it after a few disappointing plays.

**Somewhere in between Descent 1st and 2nd Editions is Batman: GCC.** I think I know the problem, but I'm not sure. I have played the Overlord twice and a hero three times. My friend who played the Overlord last night said that he felt as though he's not given a lot of options except to try to slow us down. And that is a fair point in any one vs all games. You're there to stop the heroes from succeeding.

**I think the problem with what I've seen in the game so far is that the scenarios are so tightly constructed that there's no wiggle room for ... fun? Maybe not for fun, but for exploration, mistakes, and really just ... options.** What if I want to focus more on trying to beat up bad guys? What if I want have an epic back and forth battle with Bane or Deathstroke? There's no real way to do that. And while I recognize the validity in making a game that is in many ways a puzzle to figure out how to accomplish a specific task, it makes the game very frustrating when you are dependent on dice that have A LOT of blank sides.

As we discussed the game last night, we compared it to Gloomhaven, which is not a favorite of mine. The scenarios in Gloomhaven felt very repetitive and tedious to me. And while I do like the idea of diceless combat, doing this can often lead to anticlimactic finishes where once you mathematically know you can win, what's the point? On the other hand, it can be frustrated to have your best plan frustrated by bad luck. In my opinion, there is no best answer for every situation or game, and there are certainly places on game shelves for both types of games.

**So what is to be done with Batman? Is it broken? No, I don't think so. But it's not very accessible, and it's clearly not attracting the kind of sales and raves and just general love you would think a Batman game would. It's easy to tell that the designers put a lot of love into the game, but I am starting to think that maybe they put too much love into it.**

There's so much going on. More than there needs to be. Do we need difficult and dangerous terrain? Do we need different levels of jumps and climbs? Do we need falls? Do we need Two different categories of complex thought and manipulation? Do we need to be able to throw items? On the one hand, it's great that there are so many skills to be able to create unique characters, but at some point there's too much. And I think Batman found the ""too much"" point. We find ourselves studying up on the characters and the skills for up to 30-45 minutes before we start playing.

**We still don't feel after 5 plays that we have a full grasp on everything.** Yet after 5 plays of War of the Ring, I don't have to look up things in the rulebook. But I do with Batman. I have no problem with this trying to be the War of the Ring of the Batman world, but one of the trademarks of War of the Ring is that there are so many options and strategies in it that the dice are secondary, whereas in Batman you often live and die by your complex thoughts and manipulation rolls.

So what is to be done? Well, here's where I make a plea to Monolith. **I think this game can be saved, but I think there needs to be some changes and a 2nd edition rule set/kit released to really live things up.**

1. **Find a way to loosen up the scenarios.** One thing I have thought of doing is giving both sides more cubes. That way the villain can be more flexible in which tiles to activate. The heroes will not feel so tied down to make every single turn work out perfectly or else despair starts to set in.

2. **Favor the heroes more.** Psychologically speaking, in a one vs all, the all should have a little more chance at winning than the one. This may be my opinion, but I don't know. In any game I play as the one, I almost feel a little bad when I win, whereas I always love to see everyone have a good time.

3. **Trim the fat.** Figure out what doesn't really need to be in the game. Look at some of the things I suggested. Talk to people who own the game and find out what they like and don't like, and most of all find out why the people who own your game and haven't played it yet haven't gotten it to the table. What can you do? I think that's what's killing Batman is the fact that people have it but are intimidated.

4. **Spend the money to overcome your language barriers.** You have to accept the fact that you totally screwed up your rulebook and your mission book, partly due to language issues and partly due to sloppiness. I say this as someone who has read and reread the rulebook, knows how to navigate it, and still is frustrated by it. It sucks. This could have been avoided.

**I really really want this game to shine. I adore so much about it.** I would love to see what the minds behind this game and the community that supports it can do to take it from what it is to what it can be. Maybe I'm the voice in the minority here and most people are going to disagree with me. Maybe I'm one of the few who just didn't realize what I was getting into. But I hope not. I plan to continue to try to get this to the table regularly, but I feel my game group struggling to love it the way we want to. I think we're going to try this game with more cubes and see how it goes first, and then go from there.

Thank you for taking the time to read this! I would love for this game to become what it almost deserves to be: a pillar of what someone can do when blending a terrific theme, well-thought out and diverse missions and scenarios, high variability in mission planning and character choice, and one-vs-all dungeon crawlers.",t2_csnce,False,,0,False,Dear Monolith Games (A Review of Batman: Gotham City Chronicles),"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Review'}]",r/boardgames,False,6,review,0,,False,t3_gencsp,False,dark,0.91,,public,167,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Review,False,167,,False,self,False,descent,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Descent 1E Forever!'}]",{},,True,,1588811627.0,richtext,6,,,richtext,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been posted on BGG, but I am posting it here both as my thoughts and a sincere desire that Monolith reads it and reacts as I do feel it captures not only my thoughts but echoes much of what I have read about B:GCC before and after playing the game a handful of times. &lt;strong&gt;If you want the TL,DR version, just read the bold lines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Monolith,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that &lt;strong&gt;I am your target audience. I love thematic games. I love DC Comics.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, I&amp;#39;m writing this wearing a lab coat with Superman patches sewed onto it. My game room is decked out in Marvel and DC posters and Funko Pops. I love games with minis and dice if they are well-designed. I also love one vs all games. One of my all-time favorite games is Descent 1st Edition. And I will be referring to that and Descent 2nd Edition (which I hated) often throughout this review as two base points for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went all in on this pledge, and it wasn&amp;#39;t even a second thought.&lt;/strong&gt; From what I saw, this game checked so many boxes for me. I did not buy Conan. I think I backed it and then ended up having it shipped to another person before it ever arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had so much faith in the idea that I would love this game that I backed parts of season 2 without playing it.&lt;/strong&gt; And when Shut Up and Sit Down released their very &amp;quot;eh&amp;quot; review of the game, and hype cooled on this game, I didn&amp;#39;t care. I was still excited to play. I had already sent off my minis to be painted. And I was determined to love this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So now I&amp;#39;ve played it 5 times.&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#39;ve played To Sink a City, Deadly Infection (2x), the one with Tusk in the bank, and the one with Deathstroke in the bank. I apologize for not remembering the names here. &lt;strong&gt;The heroes have yet to win a scenario.&lt;/strong&gt; Even when we played Deadly Infection last night, back to back, and had serious discussions about what we should have done differently, we still weren&amp;#39;t able to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean? Is a game not fun just because you don&amp;#39;t win? No, I hope not. Not for me. Am I having fun when I&amp;#39;m playing the game? I think so. I am definitely enjoying playing a game as some of my favorite characters. I enjoy prepping them with the right gadgets, trying to figure out the best moves to make and when to conserve and when to spend energy. I enjoy successes and seeing super-villains retaliate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s so much to love about this game. But there&amp;#39;s something wrong with it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My group spent a lot of time discussing the game last night after our first play and then after our second try on the same scenario that we still couldn&amp;#39;t win. And I think everyone wants to like it. Part of that may be that they know how much money I spent on buying it, having it painted, and just the fact that it&amp;#39;s so gorgeous and it seems like everything is right there. So what is the problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I have the answer, but I want to try to walk through this mentally, and I welcome other people&amp;#39;s input.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I play Descent 1st edition, I almost always play as the Overlord. The overlord has monsters in every room, and a earns threat to spend on cards that he draws, and there&amp;#39;s tons of dice to be rolled to attack. And with every roll for attack, there&amp;#39;s a 1/6 chance that you might miss. There are no rolls for defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the epic scale of Descent 1st Ed. Each quest is 3-5 hours and the heroes are discovering the game as they go. And it&amp;#39;s like a story you&amp;#39;re unfolding. Some of the quests are not terribly balanced, but they are almost always fun. Despite the difference in mechanics between Descent 1st Ed and Batman: GCC, they choices are often the same. Does a hero spend his turn running? Fighting a lot? Moving and fighting a little? Resting a little? And the rules can be a bit finicky. But whether you were the hero or the Overlord, you had choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the overlord, you often had a fist full of evil cards you had to choose because your threat was often limited. Do you play a trap? Do you play a curse? Do you spawn more monsters? Do you save up for a more powerful card that might give you an important edge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Descent 2nd Ed came out. It was supposed to be the new improved Descent. I bought it. The missions took about 30-60 minutes. There was no threat. No deck of cards for the overlords. The heroes were largely unchanged, but it didn&amp;#39;t feel epic at all. It didn&amp;#39;t feel like there were many choices, especially for the Overlord. I hated it and sold it after a few disappointing plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Somewhere in between Descent 1st and 2nd Editions is Batman: GCC.&lt;/strong&gt; I think I know the problem, but I&amp;#39;m not sure. I have played the Overlord twice and a hero three times. My friend who played the Overlord last night said that he felt as though he&amp;#39;s not given a lot of options except to try to slow us down. And that is a fair point in any one vs all games. You&amp;#39;re there to stop the heroes from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think the problem with what I&amp;#39;ve seen in the game so far is that the scenarios are so tightly constructed that there&amp;#39;s no wiggle room for ... fun? Maybe not for fun, but for exploration, mistakes, and really just ... options.&lt;/strong&gt; What if I want to focus more on trying to beat up bad guys? What if I want have an epic back and forth battle with Bane or Deathstroke? There&amp;#39;s no real way to do that. And while I recognize the validity in making a game that is in many ways a puzzle to figure out how to accomplish a specific task, it makes the game very frustrating when you are dependent on dice that have A LOT of blank sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we discussed the game last night, we compared it to Gloomhaven, which is not a favorite of mine. The scenarios in Gloomhaven felt very repetitive and tedious to me. And while I do like the idea of diceless combat, doing this can often lead to anticlimactic finishes where once you mathematically know you can win, what&amp;#39;s the point? On the other hand, it can be frustrated to have your best plan frustrated by bad luck. In my opinion, there is no best answer for every situation or game, and there are certainly places on game shelves for both types of games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is to be done with Batman? Is it broken? No, I don&amp;#39;t think so. But it&amp;#39;s not very accessible, and it&amp;#39;s clearly not attracting the kind of sales and raves and just general love you would think a Batman game would. It&amp;#39;s easy to tell that the designers put a lot of love into the game, but I am starting to think that maybe they put too much love into it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s so much going on. More than there needs to be. Do we need difficult and dangerous terrain? Do we need different levels of jumps and climbs? Do we need falls? Do we need Two different categories of complex thought and manipulation? Do we need to be able to throw items? On the one hand, it&amp;#39;s great that there are so many skills to be able to create unique characters, but at some point there&amp;#39;s too much. And I think Batman found the &amp;quot;too much&amp;quot; point. We find ourselves studying up on the characters and the skills for up to 30-45 minutes before we start playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We still don&amp;#39;t feel after 5 plays that we have a full grasp on everything.&lt;/strong&gt; Yet after 5 plays of War of the Ring, I don&amp;#39;t have to look up things in the rulebook. But I do with Batman. I have no problem with this trying to be the War of the Ring of the Batman world, but one of the trademarks of War of the Ring is that there are so many options and strategies in it that the dice are secondary, whereas in Batman you often live and die by your complex thoughts and manipulation rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is to be done? Well, here&amp;#39;s where I make a plea to Monolith. &lt;strong&gt;I think this game can be saved, but I think there needs to be some changes and a 2nd edition rule set/kit released to really live things up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a way to loosen up the scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt; One thing I have thought of doing is giving both sides more cubes. That way the villain can be more flexible in which tiles to activate. The heroes will not feel so tied down to make every single turn work out perfectly or else despair starts to set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favor the heroes more.&lt;/strong&gt; Psychologically speaking, in a one vs all, the all should have a little more chance at winning than the one. This may be my opinion, but I don&amp;#39;t know. In any game I play as the one, I almost feel a little bad when I win, whereas I always love to see everyone have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trim the fat.&lt;/strong&gt; Figure out what doesn&amp;#39;t really need to be in the game. Look at some of the things I suggested. Talk to people who own the game and find out what they like and don&amp;#39;t like, and most of all find out why the people who own your game and haven&amp;#39;t played it yet haven&amp;#39;t gotten it to the table. What can you do? I think that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s killing Batman is the fact that people have it but are intimidated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spend the money to overcome your language barriers.&lt;/strong&gt; You have to accept the fact that you totally screwed up your rulebook and your mission book, partly due to language issues and partly due to sloppiness. I say this as someone who has read and reread the rulebook, knows how to navigate it, and still is frustrated by it. It sucks. This could have been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I really really want this game to shine. I adore so much about it.&lt;/strong&gt; I would love to see what the minds behind this game and the community that supports it can do to take it from what it is to what it can be.

*What got you into the hobby?*

My first modern board game was **Ticket to Ride: Europe**, which I picked up around 2012.  I started playing board games in university.  I started to dive in a bit more once I backed **Scythe** on Kickstarter.

*If there was one thing you would change about your collection, what would it be?*

I think I went through a phase where I bought games I thought others might play with me, rather than ones I wanted for myself.  I still have a bit of a revolving door of a collection, but I don't want it to take up too much space in the house, so the current size is about right.

I could probably sell a few of these and not miss them as well.  But it's always hard to say goodbye.

*What is on your current wishlist?*

I have pre-orders in for a bunch of expansions/additions.  Both the  Raptors vs. Muldoon and Cobble and Fog expansions for **Unmatched**, **Undaunted: North Africa**, and the **Jagged Earth** expansion for Spirit Island, plus **Barrage**.

On my wishlist of games I haven't ordered yet: **Irish Gauge** and **Pipeline**.

*What are your favorite games?*

Currently **Food Chain Magnate** is my #1 overall.  I enjoy the 2-player experience and thankfully my wife does too.  We have been adding in modules from the Ketchup Mechanism expansion.  

Other favorites (in no order) include **The Estates**, **Spirit Island**, and **Twilight Imperium** (I manage to get it played about once a year).

*What other games have you previously owned, but have traded or sold?*

This list is almost as long as my current collection: *The Agents, Arctic Scavengers, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Charterstone (completed), Citadels, Concordia + Salsa expansion, Dominant Species, Euphoria, A Few Acres of Snow, Jaipur, Keyforge (2 decks), Munchkin, Nations, Pandemic, Pandemic Legacy S1 (completed), Pathfinder ACG, Raptor, Robinson Crusoe, Star Wars Imperial Assault, Survive! Escape from Atlantis, Unearth, Vast: The Crystal Caverns.


Overall, I'm loving the hobby.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What got you into the hobby?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first modern board game was &lt;strong&gt;Ticket to Ride: Europe&lt;/strong&gt;, which I picked up around 2012.  I started playing board games in university.  I started to dive in a bit more once I backed &lt;strong&gt;Scythe&lt;/strong&gt; on Kickstarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If there was one thing you would change about your collection, what would it be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I went through a phase where I bought games I thought others might play with me, rather than ones I wanted for myself.  I still have a bit of a revolving door of a collection, but I don&amp;#39;t want it to take up too much space in the house, so the current size is about right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could probably sell a few of these and not miss them as well.  But it&amp;#39;s always hard to say goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is on your current wishlist?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have pre-orders in for a bunch of expansions/additions.  Both the  Raptors vs. Muldoon and Cobble and Fog expansions for &lt;strong&gt;Unmatched&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Undaunted: North Africa&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;Jagged Earth&lt;/strong&gt; expansion for Spirit Island, plus &lt;strong&gt;Barrage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my wishlist of games I haven&amp;#39;t ordered yet: &lt;strong&gt;Irish Gauge&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are your favorite games?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently &lt;strong&gt;Food Chain Magnate&lt;/strong&gt; is my #1 overall.  I enjoy the 2-player experience and thankfully my wife does too.  We have been adding in modules from the Ketchup Mechanism expansion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other favorites (in no order) include &lt;strong&gt;The Estates&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Spirit Island&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Twilight Imperium&lt;/strong&gt; (I manage to get it played about once a year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What other games have you previously owned, but have traded or sold?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is almost as long as my current collection: *The Agents, Arctic Scavengers, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, Charterstone (completed), Citadels, Concordia + Salsa expansion, Dominant Species, Euphoria, A Few Acres of Snow, Jaipur, Keyforge (2 decks), Munchkin, Nations, Pandemic, Pandemic Legacy S1 (completed), Pathfinder ACG, Raptor, Robinson Crusoe, Star Wars Imperial Assault, Survive! Escape from Atlantis, Unearth, Vast: The Crystal Caverns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;#39;m loving the hobby.  I attend (or will attend, once this whole isolation thing is over) a few weekly or bi-weekly board game things and am lucky enough to have a partner who enjoys playing them with me on occasion.  Hope you enjoyed the collection!&lt;/p&gt;

Can a player march into **two** enemy territories **per turn** **(using two different March Orders)**, and as such ""initiating"" combat on two different enemy regions that turn? 

OR 

Only **ONE combat scenario can be initiated by a player per turn (regardless of the amount of March Orders available)?** In this case, all other march orders should be resolved by marching into friendly or unoccupied territories. 

Needless to say, this has caused some heated discussions during games and I'd really love to have a straight answer.

**What else does it take to be considered a scam?**

**Perhaps Dionisio's collaborators stop publishing on the networks that it is a failed project to take iron out of the matter.**

They offered us HeroQuest, we paid it, and a year later the freight to avoid losing the first wave of shipments ... and that has been more than 6 years ago. It must be recognized that what is being done against it is very ugly, since in forums they are dedicated to defame it and when it comes to the topic the same moderators and trolls lash out at those we believe to be a scam. With all this, I hope that those who believe that ""the face mask"" is going to come out, the trolls relax, it seems that they have no life except to fuck those who believe and those who do not believe, and those of the association a very kiss. fat they deserve it.

¿Que más hace falta para que se considere estafa?

Tal vez que los colaboradores de Dionisio dejen de publicar por las redes que es proyecto fallido para quitarle hierro al asunto. 

Nos ofrecieron algo, lo pagamos, y un año despues los portes para no perder la primera oleada de envios... y de eso hace ya más de 6 años. 

Me he inscrito en la asociación y hay que reconocer que es muy feo lo que se está haciendo contra la misma, ya que en foros se dedican a difamarla y cuando se trata del tema los mismos moderadores y trols arremeten contra los que creemos que hay estafa.

**Build time &amp; cost**

About 1 year (~100? hours. Honestly I lost track. Probably even more than that.. I know I watched at LEAST 40 movies while building those) from paper sketch and CAD modeling to build, decorate and finishing touches... Sometimes I'd pound like 5h in one evening and then not touch it for 4-5 days. ;_;'

~70$ CAD (~50$ USD) (including a required specialized tool from Olfa and printed Mage Knight decals.



**Materials/Steps**

1) Structure = 3/16"" foamboard (with 1.5"" pins where I wanted to add strength in certain joints)

2) Dice tower tumblers = 1/2"" foamboard (cut into 1/2"" strips and covered with thin foam sheet. Added a bunch more of 1.5"" pins to secure the tumblers. Some pins had to be shortened)

3) Interior of Dice tower = Thin black foam sheet on all surfaces (padding/noise reduction)

4) Stones = Egg cartons (rough side out) individually cut into little stones. By far THE most tediously redundant part of this entire project !.. Like seriously, F$#K those bricks !!!

5) Wooden planks = Medium thick wood grain textured paper (cut into strips)

6) Wooden trim/accents = Rigid, craft store quality coffee stir sticks (For the curved ones : boiled in water and wrapped around glass bottle and left to dry)

7) Sealant/primer = Mod Podge mixed with black paint (Pro all-in-one tip from u/blackmagiccraft to give dark base coat and ensure full visual Mod Podge coverage)

8) Paint/dry brushing = Americana acrylic

9) Washes = Varying earth tones Americana acrylic.

9) Greenery (which sadly came out way dark and unnoticeable after the next step)

10) Sealant = Minwax Polyurethane Clear Satin spray. (Again pro tip from u/blackmagiccraft showing that Minwax's aerosol doesn't melt foamboard ! 👍 In any case, there wasn't any exposed foamcore in these and there was Mod Podge and paint everywhere...)

11) Base = Thin black foam sheet



**Tools used**

1) Big cutting = Olfa 18mm utility blade

2) Precision cutting = X-Acto #11

3) Circular/Elliptical cuts = [Olfa CMP-3](https://olfa.com/craft/product/rotary-circle-cutter-cmp-3/)  very handy !

4) Long metal ruler



**[Sketchup Schematics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10VyoasGBQl2rpJK8S8R7wPW3w6yHCD1O/view?usp=drivesdk)** for the two main Card Organizers (Maybe it also includes the hero organizer, I can't remember). I haven't dropped the other ones on a Drive yet, but PM if one of you nutters wants to build it.

This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post. You can see previous versions of this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/search?q=%22%2Fr%2Fboardgames+Daily+Discussion+and+Game+Recommendations%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). 

If you are seeking game recommendations you will get better responses if you give us enough background to help you. You can use [this template](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer) to do so. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template) is a version with explanations of what we're looking for.  

Help people identify your game suggestions easily by bolding the game names. It's easy! Just surround the game name with two asterisks (\*\*) and it will show up bold. If you reply to any comment that has a game name in **bold** with ""**/u/r2d8 getparentinfo**"", one of our robots will tell you more about the game

Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.

,boardgames,"Hi Everyone, 

I just recently picked up a copy of Wrath of Ashardalon and am having a blast. That said, there were specific scenarios that we've reached and were confused so we made up some house rules in order to finish. I would appreciate if anyone has any answers. 

1) A scenario happened while we were in the long hallway and 3 melee monsters were coming down to attack us. Me and my partner were side by side, surrounded by 2 walls. Monster 1 comes up to me and attacks. Monster 2 goes to attack P2. 3rd monster, we just made it line up behind the first two monsters and did not have it attack. Lorewise, it makes sense that it would not be able to attack, because there are 2 monsters in front of it and it can't reach the target. Also, according to page 7 ""How do you move,"" Players are not allowed to move on monster tiles or in between two corners, so it makes sense that monsters follow the same rules. Is there any official stance on this?

2) According to the rules, when Ashardalon walks to a tile with other monsters, it kind of pushes them away. In the scenario mentioned before, there were 3 monsters and Ashardalon came. I understand Ashardalon can just utilize the black empty space, but where would the other monsters go? Do they go into the empty space as well, or do they go into the next tile or even pushed back into the previous tile? 

3) Are corners and line of sight respected in the game? We played with a corner where there was a orc archer. We were within 2 tiles of it, but it was around the corner. Should it still be able to attack us? 

4) Same question with knock backs. When the rage drake knocks us back 2 tiles, are we allowed to be knocked back past corners if the first tile has a wall and the only way is left, like in an L shaped knockback? Lorewise, that probably doesn't make too much sense. 

5) When we get knocked back and reveal 2 tiles, do those tiles get monsters as well?

**Any Prized Possessions?**

My 100% hand made [Sho Bu](https://imgur.com/a/qVqpQVJ) board, created &amp; wood burned by a friend

**Anything not pictured above?**

Yep! Diplomacy, Ticket to Ride: Europe, RWBY Combat Ready, Neuroshima Hex, and 7 Wonders are all elsewhere at the moment. 

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

I've been playing modern board games since the early-mid 2000's, but I didn't really get into it and start building my own collection until the early 2010's. 

**What's your Favorite game that you own?**

How do you even begin to judge that? If I were to sell all my games except one, I'd hold onto my version of ShoBu. But that's just because it's personal. So what if I lost my entire collection to fire/flooding, and I could just afford to buy one game again? I'd pick something that played well at a wide variety of player counts, was accessible to newer games while still fun for experts, and offered good variety from game to game, like Cyclades. But, if I was to use a different criteria and, say, pick the game I play the most, that would certainly skew me towards an ultra portable shorter game I'd often play multiple times each time it I break it out, like Hive. If I were just to count the number of times it was brought out my gf and I have about an hour a day for games most days, so it would probably skew towards a medium length game the plays well at two players, like Citadels/Inis/Castles of Burgundy. If I were to judge which game I think it would take me the most hours to get board of, it might be something like Dominant Species or TI4, but neither of those make it to the table often due to their length (although COVID has let us play a lot of dominant species recently) and ideal player counts. And that entirely ignores party games, which are a whole 'nother beast! Honestly, I'm really curious, *what criteria do you use to judge which game is your ""favorite""?*

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

More Games!!! Actually, I'm pretty satisfied with my collection right now, and I don't really feel the need to add anything right now. There are *plenty* of games on my wish list, but only a few of them are games that I like enough actually justify adding. The rest just wouldn't get played often after the novelty wore off.  Some of the games at the top of my wish list that I believe would get played regularly include Shogun, Glen More, and other out-of-print games that are currently too expensive to justify. I'd trade/sell diplomacy, but all my other games either get played on a regular basis or were gifts that I can't get rid of in good conscious. 

That being said, if there's anything you think I'd love based off my collection, I'm open to recommendations. 

**What's your newest game?**

Terraforming Mars. I like it enough, but it baffles me how highly it's rated. I'm honestly not a huge fan of any of BGG's top 5.   


**You Mentioned Magic: The Gathering, but that's not very specific.** 

I just have a couple of low power kitchen table decks that are fun against each other. I do play a lot of magic, but I'm pretty over constructed formats (including EDH) and I mostly just draft my playgroups [cube](https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/thearguing) a few nights a month. I think the fact that cube is much more like a traditional board game than a tcg is a big reason it's held my interest.

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

My first ""real"" board games were Catan and Betrayal at House on the Hill back in college around 2007 or so, and I haven't looked back since.

&amp;#x200B;

**What would you change about your collection?**

I'm pretty happy with the collection itself, but I'm looking for better storage solutions. I don't mind the shelves, but they're away from my table, so it's a bit of a walk to break them out. My dream for our next house is to have a dedicated room where I can display all our board games and RPG books (many of our older editions of tabletop RPGs are boxed up in the basement), as well as our literature books. A big, comfy board game room/library is my dream!

(I see lots of game rooms here; does anyone have books and other stuff on display, as well? Looking for inspiration!)

**What is your favorite game?**

Hard to pick one! I don't think I'll ever say no if someone suggests playing another round of 7Wonders or Tyrants of the Underdark. My wife and I are having an awesome time with some of the co-op games, including Journeys in Middle Earth, Dead of Winter, and the Pathfinder Adventure Card Games.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is your most played game?**

My group played A LOT of Catan when we were getting started, but recently I'd say that Wingspan gets the most time at the table.

&amp;#x200B;

**What's the newest game in your collection?/What's your prized possession?**

I'm combining these two questions, because they're the same! I recently pulled the trigger and bought three Dungeon Command expansions after telling myself I didn't need them when they released. I now have them all; they might not hit the table, but I really love the miniatures quality, and the skirmishing was a super fun adaptation of D&amp;D 4E into PvP.

&amp;#x200B;

**What haven't you played?**

At PAX East this year, I picked up the Cowboy Bebop deckbuilder and a starter set for Guild Ball. I played the demo of Cowboy Bebop and loved it, but haven't got it to the table, and Guild Ball has always intrigued me. My collector side must be appeased, so I also haven't played any of the D&amp;D Adventure system games in the lower left of my collection, but I can't stop myself from buying them for fear of not getting another chance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Any games leaving your collection?**

A few already have, most notably Thornwatch and the expansion. I was super excited for the game and was happy to back it, but was really disappointed when getting it to the table. It missed the mark for me when it should have been exactly my style of game. I would have loved a stronger narrative, with more concrete scenarios that the players go through instead of the loose comic-book style they presented. I liked the player deck mechanics, but the GM seemed a little weak. Between the rest of group not being impressed and me being deflated, I sold it at my parents' yard sale last year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Any tips for buying games?**

My wife has hit a golden rule of board games: anything bird-themed is a winner. We love Wingspan, Seikatsu, and Songbirds. If anyone has any recommendations, let me know! Also, if you have a chance to try games before buying them, that can be a lot more valuable than reading pages of reviews or being sold every time you watch a SUSD review.  :)",t2_j51n1,False,,0,False,[COMC] Full shelves after more than a decade in the hobby,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'COMC'}]",r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ge9upb,False,dark,0.76,,public,32,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},COMC,False,32,,False,self,1588725729.0,,[],{},,True,,1588754265.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanted to finally share my collection! I&amp;#39;m lucky that my wife shares my love of the hobby and all things tabletop, and we&amp;#39;re both avid collectors. I&amp;#39;ll admit that she has a better eye for games and usually picks better ones, whereas I&amp;#39;m a sucker for anything that&amp;#39;s cooperative with a fantasy theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you been involved in the hobby?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; board games were Catan and Betrayal at House on the Hill back in college around 2007 or so, and I haven&amp;#39;t looked back since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you change about your collection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty happy with the collection itself, but I&amp;#39;m looking for better storage solutions. I don&amp;#39;t mind the shelves, but they&amp;#39;re away from my table, so it&amp;#39;s a bit of a walk to break them out. My dream for our next house is to have a dedicated room where I can display all our board games and RPG books (many of our older editions of tabletop RPGs are boxed up in the basement), as well as our literature books. A big, comfy board game room/library is my dream!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I see lots of game rooms here; does anyone have books and other stuff on display, as well? Looking for inspiration!)&lt;/p&gt;

,boardgames,"I've got a bunch of board games I love and a bunch of expansions that I *don't*. Back in college I used to think that more of a game is inherently better, but it seems that a lot of expansions take a tight effective game and load it down with unnecessary and not usually fun stuff. What are some of your examples of expansions that totally botch the landing, and if you're feeling generous, maybe one that totally nails it.

**Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow's Walk** has gotta be my most disappointed I've ever been, they introduce 50 new haunts and they're almost all either broken or revolve around some gimmick that makes your stats not matter. Did you manage to score a spear and 6 might before the haunt was revealed? Well too bad cuz now we're playing Hangman!

**Bohnanza: High Bohn** is a totally reasonable expansion that wrecks the pacing of the original Bohnanza. It gives people powers, new economies, and all sorts of interesting things to buy and just flies in the face of the simple trading/screaming engine that core Bohnanza is.

**Galaxy Trucker: Another Big Expansion** is my attempt to bring some brightness. The developers remembered that GT is at it's most fun when you barely scrape to the finish line with two dollars and a trail of debris and broken promises, but as you keep playing the game you get so good at it that you almost always coast into the end with a perfect ship.

,boardgames,"Upstairs shelves: [https://imgur.com/j7WFqQM.png](https://imgur.com/j7WFqQM.png)

This is maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of my games. Most are stacked up, in boxes or on shelves in the basement.

During this stay-at-home, I shifted some that were upstairs to downstairs and vice versa.

I left one cubby open for new games.

I am a 'throw out the insert' kind of person so for base game boxes or expansion boxes you see in the picture, it usuall contains the base game plus all the expansions. Century has all three Century games in it. I could do it because I ditched the bowls. I carry a bunch of bowls in my bag always anyway so I don't need the ones that come with the games.

*“How long have you been involved in the hobby?”*

I have been a gamer all my life but really got into it around 2005.

I had been playing Risk 2210 or Munchkin and thought, ""There's some issues with this game. There must be some variant out there."" and discovered BoardGameGeek.

I then went to a FLGS and saw they had a boardgame night and started going to that. Then I joined some meetup groups and it has been my primary hobby ever since.

*“What would you change about your collection if you could?”*

Not a lot. Sure, there are some duds. For a long time I also was a person that would buy a game just because I wanted to play it so there have been a bunch I played once or twice and never again.

But a good friend of mine has Black Friday gaming event that includes a silent auction for charity and I donate some of the chaff to that every year.

*""What are some of the favorite games you own?""*

I am also have always been a movie buff and always hated the question ""What is your favorite movie?"" because I don't really have a favorite or even just a few. Same goes for boardgames.

But I now have standard answers for both questions:

Movies: ""I don't really have a favorite but I can tell you what movie I have probably seen the most times: Last of the Mohicans. I watch it about once a year. But that could be passed by Mad Max Fury road in a few years.""

Games: ""Any game I haven't played before. My favorite thing to do is learn a new game.""

&lt;p&gt;I then went to a FLGS and saw they had a boardgame night and started going to that. Then I joined some meetup groups and it has been my primary hobby ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What would you change about your collection if you could?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a lot. Sure, there are some duds. For a long time I also was a person that would buy a game just because I wanted to play it so there have been a bunch I played once or twice and never again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a good friend of mine has Black Friday gaming event that includes a silent auction for charity and I donate some of the chaff to that every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What are some of the favorite games you own?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also have always been a movie buff and always hated the question &amp;quot;What is your favorite movie?&amp;quot; because I don&amp;#39;t really have a favorite or even just a few. Same goes for boardgames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I now have standard answers for both questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movies: &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t really have a favorite but I can tell you what movie I have probably seen the most times: Last of the Mohicans. I watch it about once a year. But that could be passed by Mad Max Fury road in a few years.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Games: &amp;quot;Any game I haven&amp;#39;t played before. My favorite thing to do is learn a new game.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, Clank!, Concordia, Macao and Eldritch Horror are games I am always eager to play.&lt;/p&gt;

,boardgames,"The red flag waves. There’s one kilometer to go. The crowd roars. The riders surge forward using every last ounce of energy they can muster. The great race is reaching its climax. It’s Paris. It’s the 1930s. It’s a brief attempt at a thematic introductory paragraph.

Flamme Rouge is a bicycle racing game that features hand management, elegant movement mechanics, a modular board, and a quick pace of play. Each player controls a team of 2 riders (a Rouleur and a Sprinteur), and the first player to have a rider cross the finish line is the winner! (Or if more than one rider crosses the finish line at the same time, the one who gets the furthest beyond the line wins). The Rouleur is a good all-rounder, whereas the Sprinteur excels at occasional bursts of speed. Flamme Rouge is all about fast, tactical play, and succumbing to the charming theme and sumptuous rhythm of the gameplay phases.

&amp;#x200B;

[ The packs rounds the corner ](https://preview.redd.it/vjfnkk8mqzw41.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dff79462bac5946136b208bfb65235a440935d0)

**Gameplay**

Each player has 2 riders and their corresponding decks, each of which consists of numbered cards that dictate movement (a 3 card means move 3 spaces, a 4 card means move 4 spaces, etc). The gameplay of Flamme Rouge is deceptively simple and at times, downright ingenious. A round consists of 3 phases, which I’ll briefly go through in turn.

**1) Energy Phase** – All players simultaneously draw 4 cards and play 1 from both their Sprinteur and Rouleur decks. In each case, the 3 unplayed cards are Recycled (put face-up at the bottom of the deck).

**2) Movement Phase** – All players reveal the cards they have played, and starting with the front-most rider, players move their riders forward the number of spaces stated on the played cards.

**3) End Phase** \- The played cards are then removed from the game, slipstreaming occurs, and Exhaustion cards are taken.

It’s worth explaining slipstreaming and Exhaustion cards in detail, as these represent important mechanical innovations. Slipstreaming means that you gain some additional movement if your rider ends their move with exactly one empty space between them and another rider in front of them. If you’re clever/lucky, you might get to slipstream multiple times, as packs of riders slipstream together, so if your rider is in the last pack, they might slipstream to the next pack, and so on until all slipstreams are resolved. Using this free bonus movement is invaluable for saving your higher number cards, and it’s pretty exciting to resolve too!

As well as timing your slipstreams, careful management of Exhaustion cards is key to having a successful race. After movement and slipstreaming has been resolved, if ever a rider has more than one empty space in front of them, they must take an Exhaustion card and add it face-up to the bottom of that rider’s deck. All Exhaustion cards are 2s and so using too many high numbers early on (thus being at the front and taking on Exhaustion) can result in a cripplingly terrible deck at the end of the game. There is also plenty of room for second-guessing what your opponents might do in order to potentially force them to take on Exhaustion or miss out on a vital slipstream. As in actual cycling races, Flamme Rouge is not about zooming off at any given opportunity (although it is *very* fun to do so!), it’s all about pacing yourself, knowing when to hang back among the pack, and sensing when to attempt a bold breakaway with a stunning surge of speed. The end of the game is invariably a thrilling experience, as you play your final cards to take your riders as far across the finish line as possible.

There is also a small but crucial point regarding rider movement: once both lanes of a space are filled (you always occupy the right-hand lane first if possible) no further riders can be moved to that space. This rule often results in players wasting cards, as they may not always be able to resolve their full movement. For example, if you play a 6 card and there are already 2 riders on the space that is 6 spaces ahead of you, you must place your rider on the space behind (if it’s available). This may sound like not a big deal, but as you realise when the end-of-the-race sprint occurs, or when a few riders try to pull away from the main pack, every number counts! This movement rule also means that the further forward your riders are, the less they will be affected by spaces being blocked, because the riders’ movements are always resolved from front to back. But then being at the front all the time means more Exhaustion cards… It’s an exhilarating balancing act!

&amp;#x200B;

[ The Rouler makes a bold break for it! ](https://preview.redd.it/oq7vno1uqzw41.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c0ac819fc9030c0f786d8c31fac6978e2472cbf)

One final aspect to discuss are the mountains that feature on some sections of track, and these add an immense amount of enjoyment, challenge, and variance to the game. As you might imagine, the ascents slow you down and the descents speed you up. When ascending, no matter what number card you play, the maximum movement you can make is 5 spaces. This limitation applies if you spend any time at all on the uphill slope, so it’s essential to conquer the ascent as quickly and efficiently as possible. After scaling the peak, you have the blissful downhill section to look forward to. If a rider starts a turn on a descent space, their card always counts as a minimum of 5, so even if you play an Exhaustion card, you’ll still be shooting down a cool 5 spaces! It’s worth bearing in mind that while slipstreaming cannot occur on an ascent, it can on a descent, which creates opportunities for massive movement.

**My Thoughts**

Flamme Rouge features one of the best integrations of theme and mechanics I have ever come across in a game. The way that Exhaustion cards are gained makes the gameplay mimic a real cycling race, where distinct packs of riders form and the rider that is leading a pack continually rotates. The slipstream mechanic is also ingenious in mechanically replicating the realities of a cycling race, and provides plenty of strategic and speculative food-for-thought when selecting which cards to play. While the options at your disposal ultimately come down to luck with the drawing of the 4 cards, it is what you do with the cards (and when) that really matters!

The component quality of Flamme Rouge is high on the whole, featuring some colour-coded plastic miniatures for the riders and plenty of thick, linen-finish boards that constitute the track. The boards are modular and can fit together in a variety of ways to form different tracks, and when you combine this with the fact that the boards are double-sided, the base game has a great level of replayability. The nostalgic 1930s French cycling theme is truly wonderful; huge props to the artists Ossi Hiekkala and Jere Kasanen for capturing the spirit of the era so well. I particularly enjoyed the faded, creased detailing on the photographs that feature on the player boards, and the charmingly eccentric faces of the riders on the box art.

I really only have a few small criticisms. The first concerns the component quality of the riders; they do feel a little cheap and flimsy for the game’s price point. There is a crude ‘R’ and a ‘S’ painted on the backs of the riders to distinguish them, and the hands of the riders often come away from the handlebars. Secondly, in terms of gameplay, I have noticed a tendency (at all player counts) for the riders to remain in one pack until the end of the race, though the inclusion of mountains does go some way to countering this. While this could be praised in terms of realism, it leaves me occasionally thinking ‘what was the point of the race if we’re in the same situation at the end as the beginning?’. Finally, the constant shuffling of the Recycled cards to re-form your rider decks does get a bit tedious after a while, but these minor complaints almost disappear in light of the sheer fun of playing the game, the elegance of its mechanisms, and the delightfully executed rendition of the theme.

The game plays best at the 4-player count, as the more bikes there are on the track, the more opportunities there are for slipstreaming, pack forming, and other strategic options. That being said, Flamme Rouge is by no means lacking at the 2 and 3 player counts. The lovely tempo of the game is still there and the sprint to the finish line loses none of its excitement with fewer bikes. The publishers state that the game lasts between 30-40 minutes, which is accurate, and the minimum age of 8 feels appropriate given the game’s sophisticated simplicity. There is also a cool companion app that allows a ‘Tour de’ multiple stage event to be played, which will appeal to those of us who love a good campaign mode.

Flamme Rouge is a fabulous game that I enjoy every time I play it. The theme is fun and original, and the elegance of its mechanics makes Flamme Rouge both very accessible and tactically interesting. As such, I'm giving it Cthulhu Reviews’ first ever 8-tentacle rating!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/vjfnkk8mqzw41.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1dff79462bac5946136b208bfb65235a440935d0""&gt; The packs rounds the corner &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gameplay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each player has 2 riders and their corresponding decks, each of which consists of numbered cards that dictate movement (a 3 card means move 3 spaces, a 4 card means move 4 spaces, etc). The gameplay of Flamme Rouge is deceptively simple and at times, downright ingenious. A round consists of 3 phases, which I’ll briefly go through in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Energy Phase&lt;/strong&gt; – All players simultaneously draw 4 cards and play 1 from both their Sprinteur and Rouleur decks. In each case, the 3 unplayed cards are Recycled (put face-up at the bottom of the deck).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Movement Phase&lt;/strong&gt; – All players reveal the cards they have played, and starting with the front-most rider, players move their riders forward the number of spaces stated on the played cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) End Phase&lt;/strong&gt; - The played cards are then removed from the game, slipstreaming occurs, and Exhaustion cards are taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth explaining slipstreaming and Exhaustion cards in detail, as these represent important mechanical innovations. Slipstreaming means that you gain some additional movement if your rider ends their move with exactly one empty space between them and another rider in front of them. If you’re clever/lucky, you might get to slipstream multiple times, as packs of riders slipstream together, so if your rider is in the last pack, they might slipstream to the next pack, and so on until all slipstreams are resolved. Using this free bonus movement is invaluable for saving your higher number cards, and it’s pretty exciting to resolve too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as timing your slipstreams, careful management of Exhaustion cards is key to having a successful race. After movement and slipstreaming has been resolved, if ever a rider has more than one empty space in front of them, they must take an Exhaustion card and add it face-up to the bottom of that rider’s deck. All Exhaustion cards are 2s and so using too many high numbers early on (thus being at the front and taking on Exhaustion) can result in a cripplingly terrible deck at the end of the game. There is also plenty of room for second-guessing what your opponents might do in order to potentially force them to take on Exhaustion or miss out on a vital slipstream. As in actual cycling races, Flamme Rouge is not about zooming off at any given opportunity (although it is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; fun to do so!), it’s all about pacing yourself, knowing when to hang back among the pack, and sensing when to attempt a bold breakaway with a stunning surge of speed. The end of the game is invariably a thrilling experience, as you play your final cards to take your riders as far across the finish line as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a small but crucial point regarding rider movement: once both lanes of a space are filled (you always occupy the right-hand lane first if possible) no further riders can be moved to that space. This rule often results in players wasting cards, as they may not always be able to resolve their full movement. For example, if you play a 6 card and there are already 2 riders on the space that is 6 spaces ahead of you, you must place your rider on the space behind (if it’s available). This may sound like not a big deal, but as you realise when the end-of-the-race sprint occurs, or when a few riders try to pull away from the main pack, every number counts! This movement rule also means that the further forward your riders are, the less they will be affected by spaces being blocked, because the riders’ movements are always resolved from front to back. But then being at the front all the time means more Exhaustion cards… It’s an exhilarating balancing act!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/oq7vno1uqzw41.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6c0ac819fc9030c0f786d8c31fac6978e2472cbf""&gt; The Rouler makes a bold break for it! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final aspect to discuss are the mountains that feature on some sections of track, and these add an immense amount of enjoyment, challenge, and variance to the game. As you might imagine, the ascents slow you down and the descents speed you up. When ascending, no matter what number card you play, the maximum movement you can make is 5 spaces. This limitation applies if you spend any time at all on the uphill slope, so it’s essential to conquer the ascent as quickly and efficiently as possible. After scaling the peak, you have the blissful downhill section to look forward to. If a rider starts a turn on a descent space, their card always counts as a minimum of 5, so even if you play an Exhaustion card, you’ll still be shooting down a cool 5 spaces! It’s worth bearing in mind that while slipstreaming cannot occur on an ascent, it can on a descent, which creates opportunities for massive movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flamme Rouge features one of the best integrations of theme and mechanics I have ever come across in a game. The way that Exhaustion cards are gained makes the gameplay mimic a real cycling race, where distinct packs of riders form and the rider that is leading a pack continually rotates. The slipstream mechanic is also ingenious in mechanically replicating the realities of a cycling race, and provides plenty of strategic and speculative food-for-thought when selecting which cards to play. While the options at your disposal ultimately come down to luck with the drawing of the 4 cards, it is what you do with the cards (and when) that really matters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The component quality of Flamme Rouge is high on the whole, featuring some colour-coded plastic miniatures for the riders and plenty of thick, linen-finish boards that constitute the track. The boards are modular and can fit together in a variety of ways to form different tracks, and when you combine this with the fact that the boards are double-sided, the base game has a great level of replayability. The nostalgic 1930s French cycling theme is truly wonderful; huge props to the artists Ossi Hiekkala and Jere Kasanen for capturing the spirit of the era so well. I particularly enjoyed the faded, creased detailing on the photographs that feature on the player boards, and the charmingly eccentric faces of the riders on the box art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really only have a few small criticisms. The first concerns the component quality of the riders; they do feel a little cheap and flimsy for the game’s price point. There is a crude ‘R’ and a ‘S’ painted on the backs of the riders to distinguish them, and the hands of the riders often come away from the handlebars. Secondly, in terms of gameplay, I have noticed a tendency (at all player counts) for the riders to remain in one pack until the end of the race, though the inclusion of mountains does go some way to countering this. While this could be praised in terms of realism, it leaves me occasionally thinking ‘what was the point of the race if we’re in the same situation at the end as the beginning?’. Finally, the constant shuffling of the Recycled cards to re-form your rider decks does get a bit tedious after a while, but these minor complaints almost disappear in light of the sheer fun of playing the game, the elegance of its mechanisms, and the delightfully executed rendition of the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game plays best at the 4-player count, as the more bikes there are on the track, the more opportunities there are for slipstreaming, pack forming, and other strategic options. That being said, Flamme Rouge is by no means lacking at the 2 and 3 player counts. The lovely tempo of the game is still there and the sprint to the finish line loses none of its excitement with fewer bikes. The publishers state that the game lasts between 30-40 minutes, which is accurate, and the minimum age of 8 feels appropriate given the game’s sophisticated simplicity. There is also a cool companion app that allows a ‘Tour de’ multiple stage event to be played, which will appeal to those of us who love a good campaign mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flamme Rouge is a fabulous game that I enjoy every time I play it. The theme is fun and original, and the elegance of its mechanics makes Flamme Rouge both very accessible and tactically interesting. As such, I&amp;#39;m giving it Cthulhu Reviews’ first ever 8-tentacle rating!&lt;/p&gt;

Longer bit...

I'm a software developer that runs a little werewolf site, it's been going for a few years now, and all the games are irc-style chat based.

With the pandemic, there's been a spike in the number of visitors (as have many other game sites) and some people have been looking to play over webcam.

Using the site to handle moderator duties and syncing/chatting over zoom works in a fashion, but is a bit clunky and people don't always remember to turn off their cameras at 'night', don't always turn them off properly when they're killed etc...

(As an aside, the auto moderator is quite nice, because it means we can have more roles/interactions in game without night taking forever)

He'll likely never play the game but I know he will appreciate the art.

Then I remembered another friend I'd like to write. He spends way too much time on the computer and I thought he might appreciate a break from the screen. The thing is he's more of a gardener. So I scanned a few cards from [Herbaceous](https://app.box.com/s/yydleihrmqw05cc51brcrvufgyftl747).

I know my wife is looking forward to meeting up with her friends soon for [Sushi](https://app.box.com/s/hicgh071c9f0urjmg4ytmv6y3iwb7z4r). So go (later)!

I thought maybe I could convince (bribe with cake) my son to write some of his friends from school. So I thought [Dinosaur Tea Party](https://app.box.com/s/x3sd5z9tcv6rhham9bns48c277ikzv0i) or [Caper](https://app.box.com/s/feiwjnzqu4z4tnde25z1rrx0iqkummvv) would be a good fit.

,boardgames,"This is a tool for use with [Root: A Game of Woodland Might and Right](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/237182/root) (I couldn't figure out flair??)

I may be reinventing the wheel but I couldn't find a Reach calculator that does what I want, so I made one. Hopefully it is very straightforward to use; each player chooses their faction sequentially and the calculator displays which options are valid for a full Reach game. I am 99% confident everything works perfectly so I recommend using it yourself before asking ;) 

If not aware, Reach is a newish concept introduced to the Root board game to help determine a balanced game between any number of players. See the [Law of Root: Appendix A](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/160773/law-root)

&lt;p&gt;I may be reinventing the wheel but I couldn&amp;#39;t find a Reach calculator that does what I want, so I made one. Hopefully it is very straightforward to use; each player chooses their faction sequentially and the calculator displays which options are valid for a full Reach game. I am 99% confident everything works perfectly so I recommend using it yourself before asking ;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not aware, Reach is a newish concept introduced to the Root board game to help determine a balanced game between any number of players. See the &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/160773/law-root""&gt;Law of Root: Appendix A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Enjoy!  &lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1popZHaNPHORWupL7u5N171JRleE54FiTYyfmWoZZM50/edit?usp=sharing&amp;amp;authuser=0""&gt;Root Reach Calculator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to actually edit and use the calculator yourself you will need to create your own version&lt;/p&gt;

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

Here's a shot of the collection: [https://i.imgur.com/ZfPYpgf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZfPYpgf.jpg)

***“How long have you been involved in the hobby?”*** 

Started playing Catan, Munchkin, and most of the other games at the bottom of shelf back when I met my wife about 8 years ago. Only started really collecting about a year and a half ago. 

***“What would you change about your collection if you could?”*** 

There's not much I would change, there were a few games I bought on a whim when I first started buying games, that I will likely never play again. Those will be the first to go if/when I run out of shelf space. I'm not buying any more shelves. 

**Favorite game:**  Xia: Legends of a Drift System, Terraforming Mars, Gloomhaven. 

**Newest Games:**  On Mars (can't wait for it to hit the table when everything is back to normal.), Black Angel

**Haven't Played:** On Mars, Black Angel, Dune, Mage Knight

**Currently Backed on KS**(even though I told myself I was done with KS like a year ago)**:**  Frosthaven, Starlight, Planet Unknown, Tales From the Loop

**How often do you play?**

Before the current pandemic we used to play 2-3 times a week with different groups of people, then another 2-3 times a week just my wife and I. Now we're only playing about once every 2 weeks or so, my wife and I. Not sure why we slowed down, probably has to do with the time of year (more time spent outside, kids staying up later, more busy).",t2_6nd2p,False,,0,False,[COMC] Game Room / Now home office.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'COMC'}]",r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gdxmn9,False,dark,0.92,,public,408,0,{},,ef809fb6-18ab-11e7-9e69-0e5a4f06ecbe,False,[],,False,False,,{},COMC,False,408,,False,self,False,custom,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Xia: Legends of a Drift System'}]",{},,True,,1588713795.0,richtext,6,,,richtext,self.boardgames,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a shot of the game room, it&amp;#39;s not large, but everything fits nicely: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/D5UUHX4.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/D5UUHX4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,boardgames,"Spirit Island is one of my favorite games and with the Jagged Earth expansion nearing delivery I thought it would be fun to put together an achievement sheet. I plan to make a nice PDF once it's done that I can upload to BGG, but I wanted to get feedback and hear ideas for more achievements to add (and fun names for each).  I haven't played with any of the Branch and Claw content, so I'd especially like to hear your ideas relating to that.

I'm going to have a win with each spirit/ scenario and against each adversary but in the interests of space I am leaving these off of this post

For added difficulty, you can try beating two adversaries at once! (I'm not there yet, maybe if the quarantine goes another month)

I'd also like to add a rough ""difficulty level"" for each achievement (think bronze, silver, gold trophies), any and all feedback welcome!

,boardgames,"Hello guys and girls,

A while back I've played a co-op game with friends (2-6 players I believe), entirely based on cards. Almost like TGC (Trading Card Game) format, but everything is in the game.

You pick a card with your character. Each character has a special skill.

&amp;#x200B;

You then pick cards from the middle and your objective is to make sure one person gets a combination of certain card (lets say blue, yellow and red) to beat a ""boss"" and then you go to the next ""boss"".

&amp;#x200B;

It was a really fun game. Simple, yet fun and allowed for some smart interactions. I enjoyed how I could use what I've learned from PC games and how abilities in games work together, in order to put together a set of abilities that work for me.

One part of the game that I remember is that some cards had ""skulls"" on them for example. Which was called ""exhaustion"" or something. (skull doesn't do anything except make your hand less useful by being in it.) I remember putting together an ability to let me pick more cards when I got a ""skull"". (You all pick cards from a central pile)

&amp;#x200B;

You don't get to pick abilities, besides your main character, but you draw and discard cards in some way. Or use an ability to pass a card along to the next player for example (for his benefit or benefit of the group).

Does anybody know what that game is? It would dearly help, as it has been many years ago and there is noone left to ask.

I would greatly appreciate any help. Thank you so much!

,boardgames,"The official thematic explanation for the asynchronous ‘prepare for next season’ mechanic in Everdell is that seasons arrive at different times to different cities.

However, this official explanation is broken when one plays with the Spirecrest expansion.

4X games are my favorite. I've been pondering, which 4X game out there has the best technology mechanics in it? I've played several, but I'm wondering what you think is the funnest? Here's a few that I've played:

* Kemet (yes it isn't exactly 4X, but I like the race for the tech tiles).
* Eclipse (like kemet, you race for tech tiles, which is fun)
* Twilight Imperium
* Clash of Cultures (I love the variety of paths you can take in this one)
* Sid Meier's Civ 2010 (I haven't played this one, but the tech pyramid seems interesting)
* Heroes of Air, Land and Sea (paying workers to upgrade your city is basically a version of a tech tree, with an interesting trade-off). 
* Forbidden Stars (you can upgrade units AND do deckbuilding to upgrade your combat prowess).
* Star Trek: Ascendancy (pretty straight forward, you just buy tech, there's no tree or prerequisites or anything).
* Cry Havok.
* Blood Rage (there's a trade off between improving your ""tech"" and taking more powerful actions, interesting choices here). 
* Scythe (Upgrades and buildings help you tech up in misc ways. I like the choice of which upgrade to do, but generally the techs don't do anything particularly unique, they just improve your resource management)
* Empires of the Void I (haven't played II). 
* 8 Minute Empire: Legends (This isn't exactly a ""tech up"" kind of game, but you do make tradeoffs between short and long term gains, and the set collection aspect is interesting).

,boardgames,"Hey guys, 

Just recently bought citadels - great game.   
Quick question: with the thief, it is kinda ambiguous - does he take another character's money BEFORE or AFTER the other character has collected gold for their turn?

So, for example, let's say someone chooses the bishop, and they already have one gold. Someone else chooses to rob the bishop with thief. Does the thief take the bishop's money BEFORE he collects the 2 gold for his turn (i.e. the thief collects one gold), or AFTER (i.e. the thief collects three gold).   


The rulebook says "" When a player reveals that character to take his turn, you immediately take all of his gold "" so I'm assuming BEFORE?

&lt;p&gt;Just recently bought citadels - great game.&lt;br/&gt;
Quick question: with the thief, it is kinda ambiguous - does he take another character&amp;#39;s money BEFORE or AFTER the other character has collected gold for their turn?&lt;/p&gt;

Initial post: Hi everyone,

I was introduced to modern board gaming in April 2019, and today I have 80+ games on my shelf.

I'm always looking for other players to host and play with on Friday nights, but I hardly ever come across any women. Not that I don't enjoy playing with all the awesome guys I meet at my local FLGS, but I would really like to meet other girls who like board games and share this passion with them as well.

So a couple of weeks ago, I created a Facebook Group called [Girls Who Like Board Games](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1074944012883385/) and I'm not sure whether it's OK to post the link here or not, so apologies in advance if it's not.

Finally, thank you to ALL gamers of all genders. You are the reason why this hobby is thriving right now.

*Edit*: spelling.

*Edit 2*: I just want to precise that this post was based on my personal experience. I live in Geneva, Switzerland. Maybe gaming culture here is different from other places around the world.

It has been brought to my attention that the group being called ""Girls Who Like Board Games"" might have a bad connotation. I'm not a native English speaker and I really had no idea this might come off wrong. It was not my intention.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m always looking for other players to host and play with on Friday nights, but I hardly ever come across any women. Not that I don&amp;#39;t enjoy playing with all the awesome guys I meet at my local FLGS, but I would really like to meet other girls who like board games and share this passion with them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a couple of weeks ago, I created a Facebook Group called &lt;a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/1074944012883385/""&gt;Girls Who Like Board Games&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;#39;m not sure whether it&amp;#39;s OK to post the link here or not, so apologies in advance if it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, thank you to ALL gamers of all genders. You are the reason why this hobby is thriving right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;: spelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit 2&lt;/em&gt;: I just want to precise that this post was based on my personal experience. I live in Geneva, Switzerland. Maybe gaming culture here is different from other places around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been brought to my attention that the group being called &amp;quot;Girls Who Like Board Games&amp;quot; might have a bad connotation. I&amp;#39;m not a native English speaker and I really had no idea this might come off wrong. It was not my intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone for your comments!&lt;/p&gt;

,boardgames,"There was a post on this sub from some years ago about [a card game called Cuttle](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/2xnnx5/2player_card_game_cuttle/) by u/gaylordqueen69, which itself is made by someone called Richard Sipie, and I really liked the concept because I've been thinking a lot about the idea of a Magic-style game but with regular playing cards. Here's my proposed variation of it: Cuttle Inversed.

---

**Players:** 2

**Equipment:** Standard 52-card deck

**Goal:** The player with at least 24 points wins (checked at the end of each player’s turn). If three passes in a row occur, whoever has more points wins, and if both have the same number of points, the player who started second wins. 

Non-face cards in play give their controller a certain amount of points, and are called **‘Point Cards’**. A difference from the original is each card in your hand and each face card you control in play is worth -1 point.

The main difference from the original is one player will be the **‘Normal’ player** and the other will be the **‘Inverse’ player**. For the former, a point card in their control gives points equal to their value (Ace denoting 1). For the latter, a point card in their control gives points equal to their value subtracted from 11. Thus, an Ace would give the latter 10 points.

### Some definitions, standard stuff:

**Deck:** A shuffled, face-down standard 52-card deck, shared by both players.

**Hand:** The cards each player has concealed from each other.

**Discard Pile:** A pile of face-up cards where discarded cards go, shared by both players. **‘Discarding’** is placing cards from your hand or in play into the discard pile.

**‘In Play’:** A card is in play if it is face-up on the table and not in the discard pile.

**‘Control’:** A card is said to be in the control of a player if it is on that player’s side of the table.

# Instructions:

Both players draw five cards at the beginning. A turn consists of doing one of six actions:

1. Draw a card. If this option is unavailable, it becomes “pass your turn”.

2. Discard a card from your hand.

3. Play a point card from your hand under your control.

4. ‘Scuttle’: discard a non-face card from your hand with an equal or higher value than an opponent point card, to discard that card as well. For cards of equal point value, suits are considered. The value of suits for the Normal player will follow the sequence ♠Spades - ♥Hearts - ♦Diamonds - ♣Clubs from highest to lowest, while the Inverse player will follow the reverse sequence. (E.g. the Normal player’s Ten of Hearts cannot scuttle the Inverse player’s Ace of Clubs, as the former is of lower value than the latter. Only a Ten of Spades can.)

5. Play a face card from your hand, which have certain effects lasting as long as they are in play. You may play them under the opponent’s control.

    1. **Jack:** Must be placed on any card already in play, causing it and all cards underneath to switch controllers. If a Jack is removed from play, all cards below it switch controllers as well. In short: if there are an odd number of Jacks on a card, it changes controllers; if there is an even number of Jacks, it stays under the original controller. If the bottom card is removed from play, all Jacks above it are discarded.

    2. **Queen:** Protects all point cards the controller has in play from all opponent card effects, except scuttling (Actions 5 and 6). It protects point cards with Jacks on them, but does not protect the Jacks themselves. Does not protect cards in your hand, or cards you are about to put into play (Action 3).

    3. **King:** A point card in play of the controller’s choice has its points doubled, and another point card controlled by the same player has its points set to 0 (cannot be played if neither player controls at least two point cards). The point cards chosen cannot already be under the effects of another King. Its effects persist if either point card switches controllers at a later turn (e.g. an Eight controlled by the Normal player under the effect of a King’s doubling is worth 16 points. If the Eight changes controllers due to a Jack, it is worth 6 points for the Inverse player). If either point card is removed from play, the King is also removed from play, and its effects nullified. If the King switches controllers, the new controller decides which two point cards should receive the effects.

6. Use a non-face card from your hand for a one-time effect, and then discard it at the end of the effect (they are considered to be in none of the four areas of play while the effect is ongoing).

    1. **Ace:** All point cards in play, except Aces and Tens, are discarded.

    2. **Two:** Force the opponent to discard a card they have just played (Actions 3 to 6) and nullify its effect. Can only be used right after the opponent uses these actions, thus only usable on their turn (unless nullifying an opponent Two or Nine on your turn). This effect cannot be used on the same turn the card is acquired. As an additional cost, the opponent draws a card (cannot be played if there are no more cards left to draw).

    3. **Three:** A card in play is placed on the top of the deck face-up.

    4. **Four:** Put a face card in the discard pile into play (you must have a legal way of using the card).

    5. **Five:** Choose two cards in the opponent’s hand at random. The opponent places these cards on the top of the deck face-down in their desired order.

    6. **Six:** Draw two cards.

    7. **Seven:** A face card in play is discarded.

    8. **Eight:** Draw a card. You may either use it on the same turn in Actions 3 to 5, or discard it.

    9. **Nine:** Same effects and limitations as Two, but ~~discard another card of your choice from your hand~~ as the additional cost, the opponent chooses a card in your hand at random to put on the top of the deck face-down instead (cannot be played if it is your only card).

    10. **Ten:** The player with the smaller hand size (after the Ten is used) puts cards of their choice from the discard pile into their hand, except Aces, Tens and face cards, until they have the same number of cards as the other player. If the discard pile runs out of valid cards, they must draw cards and reveal them to the opponent until the required hand size is reached, excluding any Aces, Tens and face cards which are shuffled back into the deck. If both players have the same hand size (after the Ten is used), it does nothing.

##### Some Comments

An issue with the original was the points-or-effect dilemma: if each card had effects inversely proportionate to their points, they would be used one-dimensionally; if effects and points are directly proportionate, the game boils down to who can draw the powerful cards. So I had a brilliant idea: make each card worth a different amount of points for each player! In this version, the Normal player will be more inclined to use Ace to Five as effects and Six to Ten as points, and vice versa for the Inverse player, ensuring that cards are equally likely to be used as points and effects. It also means each player has a similar number of points available to them regardless of card distribution.

Another issue with the original was that hoarding cards in your hand was a good strategy, and instead of including a hand limit I made each card in hand give -1 point, which hopefully achieves the same effect and adds another dimension to strategy.

I didn't like how the King in the original was just a glorified point card so I changed how it works. It still functions as a point boost but does so in a more interesting way.",t2_rt79l,False,,0,False,Card Game Idea: Cuttle Inversed,[],r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gdd01h,False,dark,0.67,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,self,1588616896.0,,[],{},,True,,1588632782.0,text,6,,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a post on this sub from some years ago about &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/2xnnx5/2player_card_game_cuttle/""&gt;a card game called Cuttle&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=""/u/gaylordqueen69""&gt;u/gaylordqueen69&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is made by someone called Richard Sipie, and I really liked the concept because I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about the idea of a Magic-style game but with regular playing cards. Here&amp;#39;s my proposed variation of it: Cuttle Inversed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Players:&lt;/strong&gt; 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Standard 52-card deck&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal:&lt;/strong&gt; The player with at least 24 points wins (checked at the end of each player’s turn). If three passes in a row occur, whoever has more points wins, and if both have the same number of points, the player who started second wins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-face cards in play give their controller a certain amount of points, and are called &lt;strong&gt;‘Point Cards’&lt;/strong&gt;. A difference from the original is each card in your hand and each face card you control in play is worth -1 point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference from the original is one player will be the &lt;strong&gt;‘Normal’ player&lt;/strong&gt; and the other will be the &lt;strong&gt;‘Inverse’ player&lt;/strong&gt;. For the former, a point card in their control gives points equal to their value (Ace denoting 1). For the latter, a point card in their control gives points equal to their value subtracted from 11. Thus, an Ace would give the latter 10 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Some definitions, standard stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deck:&lt;/strong&gt; A shuffled, face-down standard 52-card deck, shared by both players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand:&lt;/strong&gt; The cards each player has concealed from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discard Pile:&lt;/strong&gt; A pile of face-up cards where discarded cards go, shared by both players. &lt;strong&gt;‘Discarding’&lt;/strong&gt; is placing cards from your hand or in play into the discard pile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘In Play’:&lt;/strong&gt; A card is in play if it is face-up on the table and not in the discard pile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Control’:&lt;/strong&gt; A card is said to be in the control of a player if it is on that player’s side of the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discard a card from your hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play a point card from your hand under your control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Scuttle’: discard a non-face card from your hand with an equal or higher value than an opponent point card, to discard that card as well. For cards of equal point value, suits are considered. The value of suits for the Normal player will follow the sequence ♠Spades - ♥Hearts - ♦Diamonds - ♣Clubs from highest to lowest, while the Inverse player will follow the reverse sequence.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play a face card from your hand, which have certain effects lasting as long as they are in play. You may play them under the opponent’s control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seven:&lt;/strong&gt; A face card in play is discarded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eight:&lt;/strong&gt; Draw a card. You may either use it on the same turn in Actions 3 to 5, or discard it.&lt;/li&gt;

# Year in Review



Last year I wrote that I want to buy more Stefan Feld games (which I did) and that I want to keep my collection at about 100 games (which I did!).
So my collection saw a lot of change because I buy and sell a lot of games. As last year I am also very happy that I never have a Pile of Shame. This is why now I rarely buy new games without a solo mode.

Last year was all about exploration for me and this year is more about master, respectively getting repeated plays out of games. 
I always use BG Stats Challenges to decide what I want to play with others.

I also started to play digital board games with friends. That's why I got in a lot of plays of some of my favorite games in.

I established a weekly game night with a good friend where we mostly play new games which is really great. Our tastes are a bit different and so this is a great exhange. We get a lot of games that the other Person didn't have on their radar.

&lt;li&gt;Uwe Rosenberg 7.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Plays:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;370 different games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;111 games only played once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;141 games played at least 5 times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;72 games played at least 10 times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—- &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Lowest Win Rate:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mind 7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love Letter 14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprawlopolis (hard) 29%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Herbaceous 29%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My win rate is higher the higher the weight is, but this is skewed because I play most heavy games solo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Most new games in 1 day:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 (Cosmogenesis, Oh Fox, Camel Up, Parade, It’s a wonderful World, Bargain Quest) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;———-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed the collection and the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask questions or give me game suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

Wanted to start by saying I really enjoy this community on Reddit, and wanted to say thanks to everyone for the fun conversations, interesting posts, and generally upbeat attitude that the /r/boardgames seems to consistently maintain. You guys rock.

*How long have you been involved in the hobby?*

I've loved board games for a long time, but I think I've been calling it a ""hobby"" for about 18 months. Something clicked for me in early 2019 when I got Hive as a gift, and that pushed me to really dive in and learn and explore. Initially I was very focused on two player games, since I usually played with my wife. But I started wanting to play deeper games and learned about solo play. From there I realized that I really genuinely enjoy solo play as a way to relax. I still play in boardgame groups on weekends and with my wife, but I think solo is my real passion in the hobby. Another thing that really helped cement this as a hobby for me was when I started posting some shots of games to a boardgame focused [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bored.gamer) account I started. It was just a silly thing to do at first but now its become a fun way to interact with the larger community about games. I've always been pretty into photography, but generally been doing it less over the years so this has been a good merger of hobbies for me allowing me to enjoy both at the same time.

*What would you change about your collection if you could?*

I think I'd pare it down a bit. There are a few games that I just don't enjoy much anymore, but haven't gotten around to trading or giving away. I'd say that generally I've done an alright job of figuring out what I enjoy and buying that, but there are a few mistakes in there that could be filled with more perfect games. I think I'd trade away Castles of the Mad King Ludwig, Viticulture, and Dungeon Alliance. All games I've enjoyed but just end up taking up space in my already limited shelves.

,boardgames,"Dark Souls: The Card Game is a co-operative ‘deck evolution’ game for 1-4 players. It is a significant redevelopment and reimagining of Dark Souls: The Board Game that was also published by Steamforged Games back in 2016, following a hugely successful Kickstarter. The Card Game is designed by David Carl, who had a hand in designing its predecessor, and while they call it a ‘deck evolution’ game, a more informative description is a co-operative dungeon crawler card game that involves some light deck-building and hand management. 

[Solo game area, by the light of the full Pusheen :3](https://preview.redd.it/hiks1488dqw41.jpg?width=2950&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0510c97e4edd1163227ef99ee112a55a64e013d8)

 In the base game, players can choose from 4 different classes that are taken from the video game series: Assassin, Herald, Knight, and Sorcerer. Each class has its own unique deck, consisting of equipment (weapons, shields, armour, spells) and stamina cards. The stamina cards represent different stats (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Faith) that are needed to use the equipment, much like Energy Cards in Pokémon. In the game, players use these cards to fight the multitude of enemies that populate the path to the iconic boss fights. By defeating enemies, players gather Souls and Treasure that can be used to expand and evolve their decks, making them more powerful and tailored to the tasks at hand.

There are 3 boards which the action plays out across: a double-sided Exploration Board that represents the players’ movement between encounters and bosses, and the Player Board and Enemy Boards that represent in-battle positions, movements, and lines of attack. The Player and Enemy Boards are 2x3 and are nice and simple to use. There are also 5 Bonfire cards, and like the video games, each time you rest at a Bonfire everything resets, enemies are shuffled back into their decks, you gain any Treasure and Souls that you have accumulated, and you have the opportunity to buy further stamina cards.

One of the most original aspects of the gameplay is that your hand doubles up as your health, so 1 card = 1 health point. For example, if you take 3 damage, and are unable to Block or Dodge, then you must discard 3 cards. This makes the entire game a delicate balancing act and adds a nerve-racking push-your-luck aspect to the combat. If you use too many of your stamina cards on an all-out assault you will leave yourself vulnerable, but if you spend too many stamina cards on defensive moves you may not have enough stamina to attack at all. With a hand limit of 6 for each turn, either of these eventualities can easily happen.

It must be said that what hand you draw does have a big impact on what you can do on your turn. If you do not draw any weapons, for example, you can take a mulligan to (hopefully) remedy this. There is plenty to think about during the actual combat, such as status effects (such as Poison, Stagger, Frostbite), Armour values, taunt values, spawn locations, and different types of attacks that some enemies may be weak to (Heavy, Precise, Magical, etc). Each enemy also has a different attack range and pattern, which emphasizes the need for effective communication between players.

The push-your-luck aspect I mentioned above also extends to the post-battle collection of rewards, as whatever Souls you earn from killing enemies or Treasure you pick up both go into a Loot Pile that can only be claimed by resting at the Bonfire (which uses 1 of your 5 available resets). If you are defeated in an encounter, you must discard all Souls and Treasures from your Loot Pile.

The component quality is pretty good, with decent card stock, a visually appealing (if a little erroneous and confusing at times) rulebook, some fairly standard tokens, and 3 good quality boards. There are plenty of instantly recognizable enemies in the base game to keep things fresh for many playthroughs, and expansions on the way to keep things fresher still. All bosses are taken from Dark Souls 3, and they are an absolute highlight. Included in the base game are High Lord Wolnir, Pontiff Sulyvahn, Abyss Watcher, and Vordt of the Boreal Valley. Each boss has very different combat mechanics (I won't spoil it by saying what they are!), and each comes with their own deck of attacks, meaning that every encounter with them plays out differently.

And now for 3 key questions:

**Does the game capture/recreate/embody the essence of the Dark Souls series?**

The world of the Dark Souls series is one of the things that fans and critics alike rave about. It is a hopeless world bathed in a dark atmosphere and a Gothic nihilism, where the characters are stuck in endless cycles of horror and despair. The Card Game captures the cyclical aspect of Dark Souls very well indeed. As in the video games, every time the players rest at a Bonfire, either through choice or through death, everything resets and the challenges must be faced all over again.

The high level of difficulty of the Dark Souls games has become somewhat notorious; it is both over-hyped and entirely true. When playing the video games, even the most seasoned gamers die again and again (‘Prepare to Die’). Crucially, thanks to the sublime skills of Hidetaka Miyazaki and the FromSoftware team, this constant punishment is not a dull grind that prompts rage quitting but an exceptionally fun part of the gameplay. Steamforged Games have got this aspect just right with their Card Game; it is very hard to win. I often find myself on the cusp of victory only to be snapped up by the jaws of defeat once more. This tendency to ‘only just win’ reminds me of Pandemic, where victory can be equally hard to come by. Crucial to the difficulty is the scaling, which works well according to the number of players. The scaling device is simple, consisting of a greater number of enemies drawn for each encounter and a greater amount of Treasure that can be gained. The weighting feels correct for each player count, and rarely feels too easy or unfair.

Two aspects of the video games that are particularly praised are the atmosphere and the level design. Sadly, neither of these aspects make the transfer to the Card Game effectively. The artwork on the cards and boards does conjure up the gloomy aesthetic of the video games to a certain extent, although the image sizes are a little on the small side (likely to accommodate the required information on the cards). The garish colours on the stamina cards are also a strange choice, given the ready-made death and decay aesthetic that Dark Souls comes with.

There has been no attempt to mimic the innovative level design and movement of the video games, where players frequently forge off into new areas only to find themselves back where they started, or take a quick look down a seemingly small side path and discover the entire next section of the game. In Dark Souls: The Card Game the movement around the Exploration Board feels completely arbitrary and has little bearing on the encounters, other than deciding the level of the enemies you will face.

**Is the game enjoyable for players who aren't fans of the Dark Souls series?**

Absolutely, I would say the mechanics more than hold their own if the Dark Souls context is removed. However, a certain investment or interest in RPGs more generally (or at least not being averse to them) is likely to be a key factor in whether you love the game or simply like it a little. The 4 character classes in the base game are fairly typical in RPG terms, and the while the weapons look cool and are varied enough, unless you recognise them from the Souls series they are unlikely to give you that surge of bonus excitement. Crucially, however, the pace of the gameplay, the variety of the combat, and the collaborative player interaction ensures that the game is a worthwhile experience for everyone.

**How does Dark Souls: The Card Game compare to Dark Souls: The Board Game?**

Dark Souls: The Card Game is a much more streamlined experience than the Board Game, requiring significantly less time to set-up and play. A solo game usually takes me around 60 mins, with more players taking it up to around 80 mins. When compared with the 3-4 hours (minimum) needed to play Dark Souls: The Board Game, this feels positively rapid. I found that the set-up of the Card Game took around 30 mins during my first couple of games, but this dropped to around 15 mins after a few playthroughs. The word ‘grind’ recurs frequently in relation to Dark Souls: The Board Game, with extensive level ups and upgrades required to progress through the game. This has been extensively stripped back for the Card Game, with the ‘deck evolution’ occurring only occasionally and not taking up too much time. Ultimately whether you prefer the Board Game or the Card Game will depend on what kind of experience you are looking for, but the Card Game edges it for me, offering a similar cooperative combat experience in a fraction of the time.

**Final Thoughts**

Overall, Dark Souls: The Card Game is an enjoyable experience. If you like the Soulsborne series, RPGs more generally, or games like Magic: The Gathering and Arkham Horror: The Card Game, then chances are you'll find plenty to love here. It is not without its flaws, but ultimately Dark Souls: The Card Game delivers a fun challenge that requires cooperation, strategy, and a dash of luck to win.

I love Tzolk'in. This project has been on the back burner for a couple years, but it wasn't until all the COVID time on my hands that I actually got around to finishing everything. I'm super proud of the results, even though I can't play with the game group during  quarantine.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the pimpin' rundown:

I painted each of the outside gears to match its color on the board while trying to keep the shades ""earthy."" I primed the center wheel before painting the patterns on it.

For the [center wheel](https://i.imgur.com/r7bId4e.jpg), I limited it to a 5 color palette and tried to keep to what felt like ""authentic"" Mayan colors. I couldn't BELIEVE how much time it took to complete this. I then used a wash on it to give it an antiqued look. That's one thing I wasn't happy with and wish I hadn't done it, but oh well. By the way, Czech Games was super helpful when I reached out some time ago after goofing up with priming the main wheel. I ordered (and paid for) a replacement, but their communication was fantastic, it arrived quickly, and came with a lot of little extras I didn't ask for. It all felt really personal.

I ordered the 3D-printed pyramids and center ""coin"" available from Shapeways and [painted them](https://i.imgur.com/a6OTn82.jpg). I also made sure to reapply the the original stickers on the gears [under the pyramids](https://i.imgur.com/6Rletd2.jpg?1), since who can remember the name of each otherwise?

The Top Shelf Gamer [resources](https://i.imgur.com/HlFHbN7.jpg) are great, but I wasn't a fan of the corn's [original paint job](https://www.topshelfgamer.com/products/corn-tokens-set-of-10). So I [repainted them](https://i.imgur.com/DPxucdi.jpg) to look more like real corn.

On the other hand, playing some of the other games around helps to keep in touch with what's popular, what's interesting, what some of the innovative mechanisms being created by other designers are, what will create buzz, and so forth.

,boardgames,"**Welcome to /r/boardgames Daily Discussion and Game Recommendations**

This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post. You can see previous versions of this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/search?q=%22%2Fr%2Fboardgames+Daily+Discussion+and+Game+Recommendations%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). 

If you are seeking game recommendations you will get better responses if you give us enough background to help you. You can use [this template](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer) to do so. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template) is a version with explanations of what we're looking for.  

Help people identify your game suggestions easily by bolding the game names. It's easy! Just surround the game name with two asterisks (\*\*) and it will show up bold. If you reply to any comment that has a game name in **bold** with ""**/u/r2d8 getparentinfo**"", one of our robots will tell you more about the game

Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.

* If asking people for recommendations is too interactive: [The Automated Recommendations Robot is here for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig#wiki_ask_a_robot_for_a_list_of_recommendations).
* For recommendations that take accessibility concerns into account, check out [MeepleLikeUs](https://meeplelikeus.co.uk/recommender-beta/) and their recommender.

,boardgames,"So, I primarily play games with my wife and, prior to the apocalypse, family, and we’ve really only been playing modern games for the past few years, starting with TTR and Photosynthesis. And even until the last year or so (since moving away from everything and everyone we know to a new city) we weren’t playing all that much. Now we’re up to playing three or four nights a week, and it’s great. But we’re on the lighter side of the spectrum and, being the one that typically buys, I have been wary of more complex games because both of us tend to get bored with complex, fiddly rules. 

However, I was curious about Uwe Rosenberg because so many people seem to go totally nuts about his games. I mean, of course Patchwork, because Patchwork!, but hadn’t tried anything more complex. But I recently picked up At the Gates of Loyang when it was on sale at CSI, after watching Rahdo’s runthrough (he makes it seem soooo easy!), and we played it last night. Actually the night before... and yesterday afternoon... and last night. 

We loved it! My wife was asking to play again as soon as we finished. My brain was a little numb and I asked to defer to the next day, but damn what a fun game. And, confession: when I said we played three times over the previous two days, that was a single (our first!) game. Sure, we’re slow, but it was fun helping each other through the decision space.

I particularly like the complexity of managing different fields in various stages of play, the weight of casual vs regular customers and their respective bonuses, and the complexity of resource trading while keeping your markets to a minimum. I dunno, just super fun all around. 

We also played without the interaction cards, following again from Rahdo. We’ll probably play a couple more games without them to get used to the mechanics of the game, but after reading them, they seem kinda fun so will probably incorporate them back in shortly.

If I had any criticism, it would be that some of the helper cards have kinda vague descriptions and it can be a little difficult to understand how the action is used at all, let alone how to fit it into a complex strategy. 

So if I had any questions, it would be how do people feel this game compares to Reykholt, as I understand that was based off the mechanics of Loyang? And also maybe what other games fill a similar
niche? Not really interested in AFFO; that game just seems a bit ridiculous especially for someone with only a 42” round table. I’m not trying to to raise the mean complexity of my game collection or anything, but something with a similar economic mechanic would be nice.

And even until the last year or so (since moving away from everything and everyone we know to a new city) we weren’t playing all that much. Now we’re up to playing three or four nights a week, and it’s great. But we’re on the lighter side of the spectrum and, being the one that typically buys, I have been wary of more complex games because both of us tend to get bored with complex, fiddly rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was curious about Uwe Rosenberg because so many people seem to go totally nuts about his games. I mean, of course Patchwork, because Patchwork!, but hadn’t tried anything more complex. But I recently picked up At the Gates of Loyang when it was on sale at CSI, after watching Rahdo’s runthrough (he makes it seem soooo easy!), and we played it last night. Actually the night before... and yesterday afternoon... and last night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We loved it! My wife was asking to play again as soon as we finished. My brain was a little numb and I asked to defer to the next day, but damn what a fun game. And, confession: when I said we played three times over the previous two days, that was a single (our first!) game. Sure, we’re slow, but it was fun helping each other through the decision space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly like the complexity of managing different fields in various stages of play, the weight of casual vs regular customers and their respective bonuses, and the complexity of resource trading while keeping your markets to a minimum. I dunno, just super fun all around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also played without the interaction cards, following again from Rahdo. We’ll probably play a couple more games without them to get used to the mechanics of the game, but after reading them, they seem kinda fun so will probably incorporate them back in shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had any criticism, it would be that some of the helper cards have kinda vague descriptions and it can be a little difficult to understand how the action is used at all, let alone how to fit it into a complex strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if I had any questions, it would be how do people feel this game compares to Reykholt, as I understand that was based off the mechanics of Loyang? And also maybe what other games fill a similar
niche? Not really interested in AFFO; that game just seems a bit ridiculous especially for someone with only a 42” round table. I’m not trying to to raise the mean complexity of my game collection or anything, but something with a similar economic mechanic would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a fair few different ways to play Cards against humanity out there already. However, as a software engineer by trade, the fact that there was a limit on the number of games that were going at once frustrated me! Why should I have to wait to play a card game with my friends?!

This is why I wrote [https://cardsagainstformality.io/](http://cardsagainstformality.io/). Cards against formality is a cards against formality clone, that tries to embrace the community and feel of the original game - whilst making the experience flow smoothly and enable the user to quickly create/shard a game with their friends.

Cards against formality is, and always will be free to play. I'm currently personally covering all server costs. If the website packs up I may add a way to support the servers and help keep the game alive! You can buy the original Cards against humanity cards here [https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/).

The game is still under development, However, it is fully functionality. There are still much more features to come! Currently the website is intended to be played on a larger screen, like a desktop / laptop.

The technical details:

I know there are a fair few developers who linger in this sub-reddit! This application is written with a simple React front-end. The backend follows an event-driven microservice architecture. This means that each part of the application (i.e. Cards, Clients, Decks, etc...) is an independent server, with its own Database and Cache. Each service in the application communicates via a queue/bus. The nature of this architecture allows each service to be written in a different language, and allows any Database or Cache to be used per service. In most cases, the services are written in Typescript Nodejs with MongoDB as the database and Redis as the cache. This allows for each part of the application to be independently scaled, and for important highly requested information to be cached.

The backend application is deployed on GCP's Kubernetes management controller (GKE). Each part of the application will automatically scale up or down depending on the resource usage of the server.

Cards against formality is Open Source, You can contribute to making the game better here [https://github.com/jordanpawlett/cards-against-formality](https://github.com/jordanpawlett/cards-against-formality)!

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#hmm&lt;/code&gt; means that something about the project seems a little off. Buyer beware kinda thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#lolwut&lt;/code&gt; is reserved for projects that seem like copycat games or campaigns put together with little thought. Check &amp;#39;em out for amusement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#take&lt;/code&gt; tags are for projects that have been restarted for some reason, with the number indicating what iteration we&amp;#39;re currently on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I miss something? Particularly something &lt;strong&gt;new in the last 7 days&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;? Let me know in the comments and I&amp;#39;ll add it in.&lt;/li&gt;

,boardgames,"I got into collecting board games right before quarantine started, and I have bought about 15 games since then. Most of them have been from the r/boardgamedeals subreddit, where I usually pick up games that are &gt;$30 off and have a BGG rating of &gt;6.5. And sometimes, I will just randomly buy a game from Walmart or Target if I hear its really popular. I guess I have a bad habit of being an impulsive buyer, but money isn't exactly a huge issue for me.

Some of these games, I have never played before, and neither have my friends. And to be honest, playing them with friends for the first time might be anxiety-inducing. Questions like ""What if they don't like this game?"" or ""What if they're super bored, or what if this game is mechanically broken?"" usually race through my head. 

Whenever we have board game nights, people usually have a good time, but usually, people bring good board games over. I just started collecting them recently, and have brought over Sushi Go and Coup, which were met decently well, but I have played those games before. But if I bring over a game I've never played before, I feel kinda anxious running the risk of ""What if they don't like it?"" And what if I join a board game meetup group, and they're the same way? 

I haven't been playing board games because the people I know would rather isolate themselves, so my board game collection of unplayed games is increasing.

Posted a list of great TTS mods last week, but didn't realize third party mods would get the post removed. Here's a list of some officially commissioned or authorized implementations that I've really liked so far during quarantine.

All my game groups have converted over to playing on Tabletop Simulator over the last seven weeks of social distancing. Never played any TTS games before this time, but have been quite impressed at how well done some of these are. As always if you like a game make sure to buy it to support the designers and publishers.

Definitely add more to the list in the comments if there are other official/authorized versions.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Pax Pamir (Second Edition)**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1506351740)

*Scripted setup + refresh*

One of my favourite games of last year, glad it see it has a great TTS implementation. Such a unique game and every play of this turns out so differently. A bit daunting to approach if you don't know the game already, you need a good teacher, but I always see people looking to teach it on the TTS Discord server.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Gloomhaven**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1301493206)

*Scripted setup/UI*

Really well made implementation of Gloomhaven, does all the scenario setup for you. Be sure to read the quick start guide.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Hats**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1818691898)

*Scripted setup*

If you like small card games like **Parade**, **Arboretum**, **Startups** or **Piepmatz**, then you might like **Hats**. The turns are very simple as you play a card and draw a card. But the cards you play affect the values of the different colours of hats in the game, you have to keep an eye on colours that other players are collecting because they will want to increase the value of those suites. Definitely try this one out if you small card games with some agonizing decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Dice Throne (Season One)**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=908560170)

*Scripted setup*

Very nicely done version of this 1v1 dice game, easy to learn as well from either the rule book or the many tutorial videos online. Great way to try the game as the Season One reprint with the new art and the co-op version (**Dice Throne Adventures**) are coming to retail this year.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Millenium Blades**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1517142373)

*No scripting, manual setup*

Love this Level 99 gem, it's got such a unique theme as a collectible card game simulator. You are buying and selling cards and packs of cards, and trying to collect sets and special cards along the way. At the end of each round you have a tournament with your cards. You have to be pretty familiar with the rules to play this one but it's a well done officially commissioned implementation.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Viscounts of the West Kingdom**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2019629680)

*Scripted setup (but you have to draft starting cards yourself)*

Probably the best of the West Kingdom trilogy for me (didn't care for Architects, but enjoyed Paladins). I like Viscounts for the take on deck building, and the gameplay translates pretty well on TTS. Definitely a nice way to try it out ahead of the retail release. I like deck building games where you can really tailor your deck to your play style, and Viscounts seems to deliver. Definitely convinced me to pick up a retail copy.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Paladins of the West Kingdom**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1674469035)

*Scripted setup*

Nice worker placement game where you have your own worker placement spots on your tableau, the core of the game revolves around optimizing the actions you can take each round because each worker placement spot requires different mixes of worker types. Good game, though has a tendency to run a bit long.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Roll Player**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=566893683)

*No scripting, manual setup + refresh*

Really enjoy this game and have played it (IRL) quite a bit. The core game revolves around dice and card drafting in order to build your RPG character stats. tThe dice you choose each round also determines your turn order in drafting special power and item cards to boost your character. The dice are placed in your tableau and there is definitely some puzzle of where to place your dice to best boost your stats and trigger special abilities. If you enjoy the drafting and puzzle of **Sagrada**, you might like this one too.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Pax Renaissance (Second Edition)**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2057648386)

*Scripted setup*

You really have to know the rules well, but this worked fine on TTS, amazing game each time I play, second only to Pax Pamir (First Edition) in my top Pax games. It is however a very opaque game, so I don't know if I would recommend playing on TTS unless one or two players are very familiar with the rules and can teach well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Other official/authorized mods, but I haven't tried yet:**

&amp;#x200B;

[**Medium**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1363102754)

Great team-based party game where you are trying to ""mind meld"" and say the same word based on a set of clues, works well even at lower player counts.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Bus**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2053792305&amp;searchtext=bus)

Outstanding worker placement game from the designers of **Food Chain Magnate**, **Indonesia** and **Great Zimbabwe**. Bus is one of the first worker placement games every designed, it's highly cutthroat and has unique route building and pick-up and delivery gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Iwari**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1661412839)

*Scripted setup*

Retheme of **China** / **Han** / **Web of Power** from Thundergryph games, they've really done a great job with their TTS implementations like **Hats**, nice to see companies use TTS as a marketing tool. Really enjoyed my past plays of **China** and **Web of Power** so looking to check this out soon.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Tang Garden**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1387416261)

*Scripted setup*

Another nice TTS implementation from Thundergryph, looking forward to trying this one.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Empyreal: Spells &amp; Steam**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1336181717)

*Scripted setup*

Pick-up and deliver game from Level 99. The KS just fulfilled a couple months ago, nice way to try out the game ahead of the retail release, have heard some good things about it.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Root (base)**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1164892051&amp;searchtext=root)

[**Root (alternate with all expansions)**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1297678386)

Love **Root** and this seems like a great way to play the base game online. Haven't tried it yet but did load it up and all the assets look good. Great game though.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Pax Viking**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2068449826)

*Kickstarter demo*

Haven't tried this yet, but it's touted as a more accessible Pax game, even more so than Pax Pamir Second Edition. From a brief look at the gameplay it still seems quite involved and the Pax flavour of multiple victory routes is still at the core.

&amp;#x200B;

[**SPQF**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1446340491)

*Scripted setup*

Coming this year rethemed as [Fort](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/296912/fort) from Leder Games, looking to try this out as I'm planning on pre-ordering the upcoming retheme.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Prêt-à-Porter**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1796143161)

*Kickstarter demo, scripted setup*

New edition with revised artwork.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Pixel Tactics**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=903694556)

1v1 card game from Level 99.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Vast: The Mysterious Manor**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1226877155)

The original Vast is also available too.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Villages of Valeria**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=592947368)

*Kickstarter demo, no scripting, manual setup*

Role selection card game in the same vein as games like San Juan, pick an action and other players get to follow. Cards you build into your tableau augment and boost your actions.

Set card aside, any time an epidemic is pulled, 3 cubes are added to that city and shuffled back into infection deck with the others. (aka, enact a law that would reduce spread, but at some point cause people to riot and outbreak)

-Discard an event card and a city card to lessen the number of cards required to cure the discarded city card's disease. (aka throwing away or not using certain resources, but speeding the cure, not 100% applicable to current situation, but a positive balanced with a negative).

So, I just got into boardgaming at the beginning of the year, but was getting out of Magic: the Gathering and bought A LOT of games very quickly. I just wanted to have a bunch of different games to try and figure out which type of games my playgroup enjoyed. I finally got around to building my Kallax after just moving into a new house a month ago (luckily I ordered the boardgame table and Kallax before everything closed down.) It's funny because half the rooms in our house are pretty barren right now, but the gaming room is full furnished minus some stuff we want to hang on the walls.

There isn't much I'd really change about my collection currently, but there are a few games I wasn't a fan of on my first playthrough or two that I want to give another chance. If I still don't enjoy them, they I will probably try to find a new home for them. The only games I'm really looking at still picking up are some expansions for games I already own, and a few Kickstarter's I've backed (Frosthaven, Oathsworn, and Sanctuary.)

Feel free to ask any questions!

,boardgames,"We had Closet Nerds games - The Target sitting on the shelf for years, we finally opened it up and played. However one of the rules became a hot topic of debate and we wanted to know what you all think.

&gt;The Target Adds the remaining cards to his hand and uses the ones he can to gain advanced security clearance. Players should always have 4 cards in their hands, so he discards all cards not used to the appropriate discard pile or draws enough cards from the deck where he has clearance. The Target marker then moves clockwise around the board to the next envelope or HQ, indicating the next Target.

The way I interpret this rule. Is after his buy phase (Security clearance), Players who have more than 4 cars must discard all cards in their hand. As all cards in their hand are not used. If you have less than 4 cards you must draw up to 4.
Can anyone else interpret this in any other way? Anyone know if the game designer is active on Reddit Brian Knudson?

,boardgames,"The heavy 2-player games are quite special. If you tags the right gaming partner (preferably your SO), there's nothing more fulfilling in board gaming than proper heavy 2-player games (over 3.5 in BGG). Below are the top six from my collection - probably in this order:

**Colonial Twilight**: Perhaps the easiest COIN game to get into. With only two factions to play for, this is the perfect kind of game. It's deep, it's involved and very satisfying. 

**Mage Knight**: Many say this is the best solo board game of all time. For me, this is as good a game for 2 players too. Good game to discuss plans, strategise and see how the game develops (even when played competitively). 

**Gallerist**: Can play from 1-4 players but the game is brilliant even at 2 players. Heavy set up and set down but what a brilliant game. As crunchy as board games can get. 

**Vinhos Deluxe**: Another Lacerda classic. Have only played the new version rules. The classic rules are supposedly more brutal and that only means more fun! 

**Twilight Struggle**: This would be the top 2-player game in most people's list. I think there's no other fans that brings the kind of tension and thrill this brings. 

**Fields of Arle**: A 2-player only game (until the expansion arrived) by Uwe. Very interesting see saw between the players. Relaxing but still demanding game.

,boardgames,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little more than a month. Exactly when the state of quarantine began around here in our country, Brazil. We live in neighbor cities and the access from one another is pretty much blocked right now. Lucky us, yay. Our relationship has been virtual ever since because of that. She knows I’m a huge enthusiast of board games. I’ve been into the hobby for about a decade and I have dozens of games on my shelf. She, on other hand, is the kind of person who hasn’t even had any contact with the old classics such as Clue, Game of Life, Risk or Monopoly when she was a kid.

So today I suggested something different. I asked her to create an account on the Board Game Arena and I’d show her a little bit of this world. I explained her that we’d play a relatively simple cooperative game, only the two of us. Hanabi. She wasn’t acquainted with the concept of cooperative games; it was such a novelty for her but I knew she would enjoy the idea of building something together and not playing one against each other to begin with.

So we started to play, I explained the rules to her and she struggled a little bit in the beginning as expected from someone who has never played any sort of tabletop or card game before. She is really clever; she is a lawyer but she just didn’t have the experience in this field. It was a little abstract to her. Actually the biggest difficulty for her at first was to deal with the online platform. The system of giving clues wasn’t so intuitive for her. She wasn’t the kind of person who played many videogames as a child either. A little bit later, eventually she got the grasp of it and we started making some progress.

From time to time I had to give her some extra information about the real intentions why I could potentially be giving her that clue in specific but never telling directly which was the card. She would then ask me “should I play this card on the table then?”, I’d always answer “I don’t know, it’s your guess, just try it, it’s only a game, it’s okay if we fail”. Sometimes she would get it right, sometimes wrong, but the most interesting, she was learning. She was getting the malice of the thing little by little.

I could sense that in the beginning she was really really nervous about it. She was feeling a little bit too much insecure about booming it. Maybe that I could judge her for her performance or something as if I’d be really caring about such a thing. I lose most of the games I play, if I’d get upset with such a thing, I’m certainly in the wrong hobby. Eventually she realized that I really didn’t care about it and she started to feel more comfortable with it, as well as enjoying more and more the game until the point that we finished the first one and she wanted to play another one.

We scored 19 points on our first time (of course we had some extra help, but who cares? We had fun haha). On the second game she said she wanted to do it better and we actually did it, 20 points and less extra communication than on the first game. It was getting kinda late, I suggested if we should say goodnight and go to sleep but she actually suggested we’d play a final round. I couldn’t believe it, she really enjoyed it. I am so happy. We decided to play a third time but now with zero communication. Well… 5 points hahahha. Maybe we were a little sleepy already. A couple of misunderstandings and that’s it. Boom. We were laughing about this situation; it was so much fun. She asked if we could play some more tomorrow again. But of course! She even showed some interest in other games in the future. 

And now I’m here sharing this joyful moment in the middle of this dark time we’re unfortunately living right now. Thanks to the playful interactions that these games provide to us.

,boardgames,"**Survive** without using distribution, missed a word there :)

I'm researching self publishing a game and starting a small games company. I understand the traditional model is that your game's MSRP should be 5x your manufacturing+freight costs that gets your print run to your door (or wherever you're storing them). 

Distribution then buys the game for about 40% of MSRP, then retailers buy for about 50% of MSRP, netting the publisher roughly twice as much as their manufacturing cost, before shipping costs to the distribution. 

I'm wondering if there are any small publishers that succeed in selling direct to consumers/retailers? Like I have never seen a Button Shy game in stores and I get the feeling that the vast majority of their sales come directly from their website. And Wehrelegig Games is only selling Pax Pamir 2e direct from their website without having a traditional retail release. 

I imagine a publisher would need to have a game with a fair amount of buzz to sustain on a direct to consumer model, but as more and more people become frustrated with the pitfalls of Amazon or the poor customer service that Admodee has been giving their customers, more people seem to care about where the profits of their purchases are going.",t2_krcd8rn,False,,0,False,Can a games publisher without using distribution?,[],r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_gchbwr,False,dark,0.6,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,self,1588472350.0,,[],{},,True,,1588495131.0,text,6,,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survive&lt;/strong&gt; without using distribution, missed a word there :)&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm looking to buy Clank! Legacy and I've noticed there are expansions are available. My question is; can I play the main story now and add the expansions on at the end or should these expansions be in play from the very beginning? I've done a few searches but I always find it risky searching for a legacy game due to spoilers.

&amp;#x200B;

Any sort of clarification on this would be amazing as I can't really afford the expansions right now. If they are meant to be played from the beginning then I'll probably buy Pandemic Legacy instead.

,boardgames,"After a number of helpful recommendations on my post on the daily discussion thread, I'm looking to buy Ticket to Ride. However, I'm slightly stuck in deciding the best version to go for. 

Just to make sure I have at least the basics correct: 
From what I've read on other posts, there's the base game (e.g. Europe, Nordic and USA) and expansions (e.g. USA 1910, Europa 1912, UK &amp; Pennsylvania etc) which require one of the aforementioned base games.

I've also seen standalone games for both New York &amp; London, but presume that, by the very definition of ""standalone"", these can't be combined with expansions later down the line (please do correct me if I'm mistaken).

There will typically be two of us playing (myself and my SO especially during lockdown) but, with a bit of luck, would be taken around to family/friends in future. My interest is currently in the Europe version as, coming from the UK, it's something that feels more known to me. However, if the New York/London version can be used with expansions, I'd be happy to consider those too.

My questions are as follows:
Is there much variation between the base games/is there an ""entry level"" version that would fit the above requirements? 
Is there a version that's recommended for smaller groups and, similarly, is there a version best for larger groups?

EDIT: Due to availability issues given the current pandemic, Nordic Countries was only around at vastly inflated prices. I’ve therefore purchased TtR Europe alongside the 1912 expansion.

,boardgames," I recently created a pen and paper solitary game which doesn’t require any dice, cards or printing. The main idea was to make a game you could play anywhere when you are alone and didn’t take anything with you. In other words, how to be less productive at work?

I came with the game Doblin (complete rules below). The main mechanic of the game is two grids labeled along the sides with numbers (1-6) and letters (A-F) in a random order and different for both grids. When you draw a symbol in one space of a grid (let’s day D3), you must draw the same symbol in the space of the other grid with the same coordinates.

This mechanic can be used for endless variations of this game. The only required additions are a sequence and a rule. For exemple, in a classic Doblin game, the sequence is “O-X-O-X…” and the rule is “Do not make any line or square of the 4 same symbol”. And that’s it.

I’m really interested in the ideas all designers will be able to find with this mechanic. And the more ideas there will be, the more hours we will be able to spend playing them! So what funny game idea can you come up with?

Here’s an example of how to write your game idea.

Game name: Doblin Classic or Don’t Connect 4

Game creator: Fou Dubulbe a.k.a. Kevin Langouët

Grids dimensions: Two 6x6 grids

Sequence: O-X-O-X-O-X…

Rule: There can’t be any line or square of the 4 same symbol.

Difficulty: Normal

[Example of a finished game](https://preview.redd.it/p194ddpttdw41.png?width=250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb8c3a7bdca1006ace8d324783404ef29895fadd)

Multiplayer rule *(optional)*: One 8x8 grids for each player. Each turn, a player places one O and one X. Every line or square of the 4 same symbol gives 1 point. The player with the lowest score wins.

[ An ongoing 3 players game. At the moment, Ludie is winning with 2 points, Damien has 4 points and Rosa has 3 points.](https://preview.redd.it/62333s2xtdw41.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8323dc1ef8929ac49d4de9e73ef4e3e3e82b3dc)

If this isn’t clear enough for you, here are the complete rules of the original game.

https://preview.redd.it/ls9vx22dudw41.png?width=8910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eed0f3e4b45d47363b0cdb4768b8d6f20e471d5e

Here’s a variation example:

Game name: Animal Crossing

Game Creator: Fou Dubulbe a.k.a. Kevin Langouët

Grids dimensions: Two 6x6 grids

Sequence: (10x)Tree-House-Villager. Then draw flowers and lakes in the 6 remaining spaces.

Rule: A house can’t be orthogonally adjacent to another house. At the end of the game, every villager must have a home: this is a house orthogonally adjacent to her/him which isn’t shared with another villager (but a villager can be orthogonally adjacent to the homes of other villagers).  

Difficulty: Normal. To make it easier, allow two houses to be next to each other. To make it harder, don’t make any line of the 3 same symbol.  

[Example of a finished game](https://preview.redd.it/mtavx63gudw41.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efd1fe264752b0e2b46d322e269f6259ee73c91a)

Multiplayer rule: One 8x8 grids for each player. First phase: at her/his turn, each player choose a space and draw a villager on it. When this isn’t her/his turn, the player also draw a villager on the spaces choosen by the other players. Second phase: same than the first phase, but drawing houses. Third phase: same than the first phase, but drawing trees. Then the players start again at the first phase and then go on until the grids are completed. Each villager who has a home in a grid (see the solitary rules) gives 1 point to the player who owns the grid. The player with the highest score wins. Note that in the multiplayer game, two houses can be next to each other.

[Example of ongoing game. For the moment, every player has 3 points.](https://preview.redd.it/hyduxj7judw41.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17d263f55f7fcb76c95e71a969225778880a8863)

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/ls9vx22dudw41.png?width=8910&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eed0f3e4b45d47363b0cdb4768b8d6f20e471d5e""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ls9vx22dudw41.png?width=8910&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eed0f3e4b45d47363b0cdb4768b8d6f20e471d5e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a variation example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game name: Animal Crossing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game Creator: Fou Dubulbe a.k.a. Kevin Langouët&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grids dimensions: Two 6x6 grids&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequence: (10x)Tree-House-Villager. Then draw flowers and lakes in the 6 remaining spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule: A house can’t be orthogonally adjacent to another house. At the end of the game, every villager must have a home: this is a house orthogonally adjacent to her/him which isn’t shared with another villager (but a villager can be orthogonally adjacent to the homes of other villagers).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty: Normal. To make it easier, allow two houses to be next to each other. To make it harder, don’t make any line of the 3 same symbol.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/mtavx63gudw41.png?width=500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=efd1fe264752b0e2b46d322e269f6259ee73c91a""&gt;Example of a finished game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiplayer rule: One 8x8 grids for each player. First phase: at her/his turn, each player choose a space and draw a villager on it. When this isn’t her/his turn, the player also draw a villager on the spaces choosen by the other players. Second phase: same than the first phase, but drawing houses. Third phase: same than the first phase, but drawing trees. Then the players start again at the first phase and then go on until the grids are completed. Each villager who has a home in a grid (see the solitary rules) gives 1 point to the player who owns the grid. The player with the highest score wins. Note that in the multiplayer game, two houses can be next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/hyduxj7judw41.png?width=500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=17d263f55f7fcb76c95e71a969225778880a8863""&gt;Example of ongoing game. For the moment, every player has 3 points.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
