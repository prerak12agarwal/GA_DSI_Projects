,AskMen,"During quarantine I matched with and have been snapchatting daily with this girl from Bumble. She's definitely younger and more immature (she's 18, I'm 22) but I really like her. She's adorable and sarcastic and crazy and youthful. There has been some turbulence. At one point I was going to delete from Snapchat because I thought she wasn't interested, and I have been going through some shit lately,  but decided to just ask her about it. She said she is sorry if she gave the impression that she doesn't like me and she just doesn't pay too much attention to her phone or make a bid deal out of messaging. 

So fast forward a bit, after that conversation we've been messaging a lot more and sending snaps back and forth etc. But last night she said that I can obviously read her quite well and guess stuff about her (previous conversations, I'm a psych major and we were talking about how I could analyze her and try to figure her out etc). She basically said ""tell me why all guys leave me or stop talking to me after a month or two"". And then it got kinda deep and kinda weird and we both got a little upset. She basically was still upset at some guy she really liked who ghosted her, and she has depression, etc. I was getting mad because why the fuck should I always be put in these conversations (I get it, I'm a good listener and deep conversationalist lol), and also wasn't happy because she was making some jokes/exaggerating about self-harm, and as someone who has been there, and also someone who has volunteered as a crisis counselor and studies psychology, I wanted to make it clear that if she was really feeling those things I wanted to know, a d if she was gonna joke about it, even if depressed, I didn't want to be part of the conversation anymore.

So now idk how to proceed. I am so tired of being typecast as the good guy and thrown in the friendzone. I also don't want to just pretend that conversation didn't happen and I want to make sure she knows that I care about how she feels.....I just don't care about how she feels about that last guy.

,AskMen,"This is a genuine curiosity of mine that I recently discussed with a close guy friend, who couldn't really express/find words to explain why he felt he wasn't good enough/inadequate for his girlfriend when in fact he's a great partner!

I have had this happen to me in a previous relationship, but also with a person I recently started seeing. I can quite openly admit that I am quite a confident person and sometimes have been told that this can make me somewhat intimidating with new people in my life (not sure if this is a contributing factor).

In my last serious relationship, 'I am not good enough for you' was a constant comment I got from my ex. This made me tend to work a lot on building his confidence, and a lot of the times, tone my personality/knowledge down in social and work situations as he didn't like feeling like he was having to 'keep up'. (This relationship might be one of the reasons why this comment bothers me so much).

On the other hand, the person I am currently seeing, expressed 'you're way too good for me' has been brought up a couple of times. He has expressed it however in a more charming manner, and tends to be paired with excitement/confusion as to why I'm interested in him in the first place, and makes his usual extremely confident demeanour a lot more muted and shy. 

So men, when you say this to a significant other, is this a genuine self-esteem, or expressing that you don't feel recognised enough, or am I completely missing the sentiment? Do you genuinely mean that you don't think you're good enough?

,AskMen,"I (26F) have a hard time reading people, which causes me to always feel uncomfortable around people I don’t know, to the point that tend to shut off. I’m also a very frightful person, and it makes it nearly impossible for me to draw a connection with guys unless they’re extremely patient and very cautious/unthreatening in the beginning. I date women as well, and I find that even though I’m still awkward, it is to a MUCH lesser extent.

A few examples:

1) A while ago I was at a bar with a female friend and a guy approached us and asked if he could buy me a drink. I said “Why? No. No thank you. I don’t want that. Thank you.”  He asked if I had a boyfriend and I asked him to please not talk to me. My friend got really mad at me and said I embarrassed her. I was just voicing that I did not feel comfortable. I was taught to speak out if I feel uncomfortable, so I did that. 

2) A few months ago I met a guy who I really liked. We talked a lot and I felt we had chemistry. That said, he did not like the way I expressed my needs/limits. I do enjoy dating, but I don’t like being touched randomly or suddenly, even if I know the person. It startles me and makes me uncomfortable. I also feel like I cannot pay attention to what a person is saying if I try too hard to look them in the eyes, so I tend to avert my gaze when talking to people. He understood that as me not being interested in him, and needless to say, he lost interest in me. 

How do I work on this? How do guys like being talked to when they meet new women? I have some pretty specific interests (like Russian Literature, WWI, comic books, drawing, etc). Do guys find that weird? If I’m asked what I’m interested in, should I lie and say general things like “the outdoors” or something like that?

Note: I’m in the autism spectrum. I do not tend to disclose this to people I meet, especially if I’m meeting them with the intention to date them, as I find that people tend to infantilize me when they find out I’m on the spectrum, and guys especially tend to lose interest almost immediately (even though I felt that sometimes women infantilized me more, they usually did not lose interest and still dated me. Guys on the other hand were not as patient/accepting). 

Example: I was talking to a guy for a while and we had chemistry (at least I thought we did). We sexted, exchanged nudes, etc. He said he found me very attractive but that he liked that I was also “quirky”, and that he enjoyed my personality. I disclosed to him that I was on the spectrum and shortly after he said he saw me as a “little sister”, and that me being on the spectrum in addition to our age difference (10 years) made him feel creepy, so he didn’t think he could date me.

,AskMen,"For me, it would have to be my dad passing on an opportunity to become a real paid actor.

A little over ten years ago, both he and I had parts in our church's Easter drama; I was preparing to graduate high school at the time, for a frame of reference. This was a huge production at a big church with special effects, vivid imagery, and live original songs; it got a lot of attention locally, and it drew a serious crowd. Being that the performers were all people from our church, I was one of the disciples, and my dad was Caiaphas (from Wikipedia: Caiaphas in the New Testament, was the Jewish high priest who, according to the gospels, organized a plot to kill Jesus. He famously presided over the Sanhedrin trial of Jesus.)

For his role as Caiaphas, he had one major scene in particular that involved him talking to the other priests, making the plans to kill Jesus. However, my dad was the newest person to take this role, and he did a slightly different take on it than the previous actor. My dad decided that Caiaphas should be not merely angry in this moment, but absolutely furious, and he took it to the max. In this scene, he practically screamed his lines as he portrayed the character's fury. He performed his part so believably well, that it actually scared people in the crowd, and afterwards he was encouraged by many to seriously consider a career in acting.

And he did! He'd said in the past that acting was something he'd thought of doing anyway.

He found a local talent agency, showed them his performance on video, and they immediately accepted him. He took a few crash courses, made some headshots, and in no time flat he was offered a small role in an episode of an actual television show that was at that time being aired on the Lifetime channel. Obviously, I was floored by this, and very proud of him. But...he didn't take the job. His reasoning was that it wasn't a Christian production, and he was worried that a life in acting would corrupt his faith; he'd have been more comfortable being an actor for exclusively Christian shows and movies, an already very small market.

I understood his reasoning, and it was hard to argue with it, but I still think he's crazy for passing on that. Predictably, he never pursued his acting career again, it died in that moment. Had I been in that situation, religious or not, I'd be on it like white on rice.

However, my dad was the newest person to take this role, and he did a slightly different take on it than the previous actor. My dad decided that Caiaphas should be not merely angry in this moment, but absolutely furious, and he took it to the max. In this scene, he practically screamed his lines as he portrayed the character&amp;#39;s fury. He performed his part so believably well, that it actually scared people in the crowd, and afterwards he was encouraged by many to seriously consider a career in acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he did! He&amp;#39;d said in the past that acting was something he&amp;#39;d thought of doing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He found a local talent agency, showed them his performance on video, and they immediately accepted him. He took a few crash courses, made some headshots, and in no time flat he was offered a small role in an episode of an actual television show that was at that time being aired on the Lifetime channel. Obviously, I was floored by this, and very proud of him. But...he didn&amp;#39;t take the job. His reasoning was that it wasn&amp;#39;t a Christian production, and he was worried that a life in acting would corrupt his faith; he&amp;#39;d have been more comfortable being an actor for exclusively Christian shows and movies, an already very small market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understood his reasoning, and it was hard to argue with it, but I still think he&amp;#39;s crazy for passing on that. Predictably, he never pursued his acting career again, it died in that moment. Had I been in that situation, religious or not, I&amp;#39;d be on it like white on rice. To this day, I think about him deciding not to be an actor, and it really depresses me.&lt;/p&gt;

I am a teenager and like most other teenagers I wish to become a man. But I do not know how to become one. Is to be a man to be a warrior, to be of age, to have a women or none of these at all?

As I am in my youth I have alot of free time and since this pandemic it has only increased. I have nothing to do so I watch series on Netflix and anime on crunchyroll. All these stories almost always involve a protagonist of some sort who is this warrior I speak of. Every time I see something like this I tell myself that I must become this man, to become a man who is fearless, a warrior but I understand that I will probably not become a warrior. Ever since I was a child I have had this ideal to be a man. Its programmed in my brain I am constantly surrounded with the ideas of becoming a man, but they are all fictional stories. I think that this ideal is something every male has had to deal with so I ask for your advice.

I'm a 27M and I work as a self-employed person (freelance writer/journalist) and work on my first novel. I'm a hard worker busy from 7.30 am to like 5 or 6 p.m. for making money, then from 8 p.m. to around 10 p.m. on my novel. On weekend, I also work both days on my novel. 

Further, I guess like most of you, I have to deal with some personal issues and family matters.

This being said, I feel very stressed right know and can't really chill. I always have something in my mind. The worst part is that I get some digest issues because of the stress that makes me feel unconfortable and tired. 

I don't drink much alcohol (that makes my digest issues worse) and don't smoke anything. Maybe should I ? Haha.  I don't make much sport neither.

Anyway, I guess I'm not the first one to feel this way. What are your tips and tricks to chill and beat the stress ?

About a year ago I asked a girl, someone from work, out for drinks. She said yes. We had a pretty good time, ended up hanging out a lot. Watching movies, tv at her place or mine, getting food, etc.

She said she didn't want to date coworkers, and wanted to stay friends. Fair enough. So I tried staying friends.

This worked only so well, since I still had feelings for her. Eventually, she started seeing another guy (not from our work).

&lt;p&gt;Girls I date are smart (often smarter) and well caring. &lt;strong&gt;They seem to be extremely good at listening to their feelings and being more vocal/projecting of them.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to do that and it makes me feel bad/unheard at times. Sometimes, I end up needing to ignore my feelings.&lt;/strong&gt; I see this with my friends as well. IMO, it also doesn&amp;#39;t seem viable to be completely uncompromising. &lt;strong&gt;How do I find the right balance? It would be nice to feel emotionally equal in a relationship.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve never had problems with freezing up in tough situations. In general, I’m a person with slightly higher than average anxiety. It’s annoying but it also kind-of feels like a superpower. Here’s why:

In high school chemistry class, I was working on a project that involved Bunsen burners. We were in groups of two. A team of two girls next to my station had a burner with an old rubber hose that was dry rotted and it suddenly burst into flames. They screamed and didn’t know what to do. Without hesitating, I just reached over and turned off the gas source to their burner. Problem solved. Later the teacher complimented my quick reaction. I’ve had several situations like this throughout my life. 

I feel like I always know what to do when shit hits the fan. I feel like doctor strange, I’ve already mentally seen a million scenarios in my mind from assault to robbery to car wrecks to you name it. I feel like hulk, “that’s my secret, I’m always anxious.” Because being in a bad situations just feels the same as every day of my life. 

Meeting someone new? Anxious. Big project at work? Anxious. Driving down the road? Anxious. It’s not a great help with losing my inhibitions in social situations but I guess everything has an upside, eh? I fit in well enough that it’s not a huge handicap in life, so it’s actually kind-of nice.
