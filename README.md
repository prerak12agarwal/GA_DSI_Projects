## Project 1: Standardized Testing, Statistical Summaries and Inference

### Problem Statement

The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. With this new test format, **how can College Board improve the statewide participation rates for the SAT, as compared to the ACT?**

### Executive Summary

The datasets of aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates from each state in the United States for 2017 and 2018 are given. I'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors influencing participation rates in various states. Based on this data analysis, I will then make recommendations for College Board to help improve the SAT participation rates across the United States.

In this project, I utilize the following skillsets:
- Working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting
- Programmatically interacting with files and directories
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Basic Statistics (Distributions, Hypothesis Testing, etc.)


## Project 2: Ames Housing Data Analysis and Modelling

### Problem Statement

Using the information in the Ames Housing Dataset, is it possible to **predict the housing sale prices for houses in Ames, IA, USA (by employing different Machine Learning techniques)**? If yes, **how accurately can these housing sale prices be predicted?**

### Executive Summary

The Ames Housing Dataset containing observations of housing sales in Ames, Iowa, USA between 2006 and 2010 is given. I'll seek to apply different machine learning techniques to predict the sale price of houses based on their features. For ease of organization and understanding, the project has been divided into 3 separate Jupyter notebooks.

In order to predict the housing sale prices, I employ different methods of feature selection and machine learning techniques in this project. Some of the techniques/models employed in this project are:
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Regularization (Lasso, Ridge & ElasticNet)
- Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV)
- Grid Search with Cross-Validation (GridSearchCV)
- Sequential Feature Selector

Each of the models built are evaluated using metrics such as R^2 score, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to explain how well the models may generalize to new data.
