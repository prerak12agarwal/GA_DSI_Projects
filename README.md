## Project 1: Standardized Testing, Statistical Summaries and Inference

### Problem Statement

The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. With this new test format, **how can College Board improve the statewide participation rates for the SAT, as compared to the ACT?**

### Executive Summary

The datasets of aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates from each state in the United States for 2017 and 2018 are given. I'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors influencing participation rates in various states. Based on this data analysis, I will then make recommendations for College Board to help improve the SAT participation rates across the United States.

In this project, I utilize the following skillsets:
- Working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting
- Programmatically interacting with files and directories
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Basic Statistics (Distributions, Hypothesis Testing, etc.)
